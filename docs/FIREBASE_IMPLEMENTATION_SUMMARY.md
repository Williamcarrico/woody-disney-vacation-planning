## Key Implementation Features

### Authentication Architecture

The authentication system implements a robust, multi-layered approach:

1. **Client-Side Auth** (`/src/lib/firebase/auth.ts`)
   - Handles all user authentication flows
   - Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
   - Email verification with custom action codes

2. **Session Management** (`/src/lib/firebase/auth-session-server.ts`)
   - Server-side session cookie creation
   - Configurable session duration (1 day default, 14 days with "remember me")
   - Automatic token rotation for security
   - Cross-environment cookie compatibility

3. **Middleware Integration** (`/src/middleware.ts`)
   - Session validation on every request
   - CORS configuration for API routes
   - Rate limiting (60 req/min general, 10 req/min for auth)
   - CSP headers for security

### Data Architecture

#### Realtime Database Structure
- **Users**: Profile data, preferences, vacation associations
- **Vacations**: Trip details, members, accommodations
- **Group Features**: Messages, location sharing
- **Live Data**: Wait times, notifications

#### Firestore Collections
- **System Data**: Parks, attractions, restaurants, resorts
- **User Data**: Profiles, vacations, itineraries
- **Analytics**: App usage and performance metrics

### Security Implementation

1. **Firestore Rules**
   - Public read for resort/park data
   - User-specific access for personal data
   - Admin-only for system operations

2. **Realtime Database Rules**
   - Authentication required for all operations
   - Vacation membership validation
   - Message sender verification

## Required Actions for Full Deployment

### 1. Environment Configuration (High Priority)

Create a `.env.local` file with:
```env
# Firebase Configuration (Already provided in the setup guide)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyAYE4oGUJ8pDQrGiEc38zpdmmvy0M-IKEQ
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=woody-vacation-planning-tool.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://woody-vacation-planning-tool-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=woody-vacation-planning-tool
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=woody-vacation-planning-tool.firebasestorage.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=584460527088
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:584460527088:web:4f8ee57fbbcb0d69902935
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-E4NRMZ121G

# Firebase Admin SDK (Needs to be obtained)
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=<YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL>
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="<YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY>"
```

### 2. Firebase Admin SDK Setup (High Priority)

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) > Project Settings > Service Accounts
2. Generate new private key
3. Extract `client_email` and `private_key` from downloaded JSON
4. Add to `.env.local` file

### 3. Data Connect Deployment (Medium Priority)

Execute the following commands:
```bash
# Deploy Data Connect service
firebase dataconnect:services:deploy

# Generate TypeScript SDK
firebase dataconnect:sdk:generate

# Update imports in data-connect-service.ts
```

### 4. Optional Enhancements

1. **Firebase Storage Rules**
   - Create `storage.rules` file
   - Configure rules for user uploads

2. **Firebase Cloud Messaging**
   - Implement push notifications
   - Configure service worker

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Enable in Firebase Console
   - Add performance tracking
