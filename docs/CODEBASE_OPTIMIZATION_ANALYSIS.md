## 1. Critical Duplicate Services

### 1.1 Vacation Services (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Issue:** Two complete vacation service implementations with overlapping functionality

**Files:**
- `src/lib/services/vacation.service.ts` (754 lines) - Generic API-based service
- `src/lib/firebase/vacation-service.ts` (568 lines) - Firebase-specific service

**Analysis:**
- Both services handle vacation CRUD operations
- Generic service includes sophisticated caching, retry logic, error handling
- Firebase service is more lightweight but duplicates core functionality
- No clear usage pattern - both are exported and available

**Recommendation:**
```
CONSOLIDATE → Keep Firebase service as primary (aligns with memory about Firebase-first architecture)
MIGRATE → Enhanced error handling and caching from generic service to Firebase service
REMOVE → src/lib/services/vacation.service.ts
ESTIMATED SAVINGS → ~754 lines, improved architectural consistency
```

### 1.2 Cache Services (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Issue:** Two nearly identical cache service implementations

**Files:**
- `src/lib/api/cache-service.ts` (572 lines) - Redis-focused with fallback
- `src/lib/cache/cache-service.ts` (589 lines) - Similar Redis implementation + ResortCacheService

**Analysis:**
- Both implement Redis with in-memory fallback
- Nearly identical functionality: TTL, compression, statistics
- Different instantiation patterns (singleton vs factory)
- Same configuration options and error handling

**Recommendation:**
```
CONSOLIDATE → Merge into single service at src/lib/cache/cache-service.ts
ADOPT → Singleton pattern from cache-service.ts (more robust)
MIGRATE → Resort-specific methods to specialized service
REMOVE → src/lib/api/cache-service.ts
ESTIMATED SAVINGS → ~572 lines, eliminated confusion
```

### 1.3 Analytics Services (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Issue:** Two analytics services with different focuses

**Files:**
- `src/lib/analytics/analytics-service.ts` (363 lines) - General analytics
- `src/lib/services/wait-time-analytics.ts` (974 lines) - Wait time specific analytics

**Analysis:**
- General service handles broad user interactions
- Wait time service is specialized but could be a module
- Some overlapping event tracking patterns
- Both export `analyticsService` constant (naming conflict)

**Recommendation:**
```
RESTRUCTURE → Keep both but rename wait-time service to waitTimeAnalyticsService
CONSOLIDATE → Common event tracking utilities into shared module
CREATE → src/lib/analytics/index.ts to manage exports
ESTIMATED SAVINGS → ~100 lines, improved organization
```

## 2. Restaurant Data Duplication

### 2.1 Restaurant Data Files (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Issue:** Multiple restaurant data files with unclear usage patterns

**Files:**
- `src/lib/data/restaurants.ts` (777 lines) - Used in 6+ components
- `src/lib/data/comprehensive-restaurants.ts` (425 lines) - **UNUSED** (0 imports found)
- `src/examples/restaurant-database-usage.ts` (557 lines) - Example file
- `src/scripts/import-restaurants.ts` (413 lines) - Import utilities

**Analysis:**
- `comprehensive-restaurants.ts` appears to be an abandoned attempt at enhanced data
- Contains duplicate restaurant definitions with different structure
- `restaurants.ts` is actively used across the application
- Example file is useful for documentation but quite large

**Recommendation:**
```
DELETE → src/lib/data/comprehensive-restaurants.ts (unused - 0 imports)
MOVE → restaurant-database-usage.ts to docs/ or separate repository
CONSOLIDATE → Import utilities could be streamlined
ESTIMATED SAVINGS → ~425 lines immediate, ~557 lines if docs moved
```

---

## 3. API Route Redundancy

### 3.1 Resort API Endpoints (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Issue:** Multiple similar resort-related API endpoints

**Directories:**
- `src/app/api/resorts/` - Main resort endpoints
- `src/app/api/resorts-simple/` - Simplified version
- `src/app/api/test-resorts/` - Testing endpoints

**Analysis:**
- `test-resorts` should not exist in production
- `resorts-simple` may be outdated or superseded
- Potential for confusion in frontend API calls

**Recommendation:**
```
AUDIT → Determine if resorts-simple is still needed
REMOVE → test-resorts endpoints (move to development/testing)
CONSOLIDATE → Single resort API with query parameters for complexity
ESTIMATED SAVINGS → 2-3 endpoint directories
```

### 3.2 Disney Data APIs (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Issue:** Overlapping Disney data endpoints

**Directories:**
- `src/app/api/disney/` - General Disney API
- `src/app/api/walt-disney-world/` - WDW-specific
- `src/app/api/parks/` - Park data
- `src/app/api/attractions/` - Attraction data

**Analysis:**
- Some functionality could be consolidated under unified endpoints
- Risk of data inconsistency across endpoints
- Unclear routing hierarchy

**Recommendation:**
```
RESTRUCTURE → Create clear API hierarchy
CONSIDER → Unified Disney API with resource-based routing
EVALUATE → Whether all endpoints are actively used
```

---

## 4. Configuration File Cleanup

### 4.1 TypeScript Configuration (LOW PRIORITY)
**Files:**
- `tsconfig.json` - Main configuration
- `tsconfig.strict.json` - Stricter rules (30 lines)
- `custom-next-env.d.ts` and `next-env.d.ts` - Type definitions

**Analysis:**
- `tsconfig.strict.json` appears unused
- Two Next.js type definition files (potential conflict)

**Recommendation:**
```
VERIFY → If tsconfig.strict.json is referenced anywhere
REMOVE → If unused, delete tsconfig.strict.json
CONSOLIDATE → Next.js type definitions into single file
```

### 4.2 System Files (LOW PRIORITY)
**Issue:** Multiple .DS_Store files tracked in repository

**Files Found:**
- `src/.DS_Store`
- `src/components/.DS_Store`
- `src/lib/.DS_Store`
- Root `.DS_Store`

**Recommendation:**
```
DELETE → All .DS_Store files immediately
VERIFY → .gitignore includes .DS_Store (confirmed present)
CLEANUP → Add to pre-commit hooks to prevent future additions
```

---

## 5. Architectural Inconsistencies

### 5.1 Service Pattern Inconsistency (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Issue:** Mixed service instantiation patterns

**Patterns Found:**
- Singleton pattern (`ServiceClass.getInstance()`)
- Direct instantiation (`new ServiceClass()`)
- Factory exports (`export const service = new ServiceClass()`)

**Examples:**
```typescript
// Singleton pattern
export const vacationService = VacationService.getInstance()

// Direct export
export const analyticsService = new AnalyticsService()

// Mixed usage creates confusion
```

**Recommendation:**
```
STANDARDIZE → Choose one pattern (recommend singleton for stateful services)
REFACTOR → Update all services to use consistent pattern
CREATE → Service factory if needed for dependency injection
```

### 5.2 Import Path Inconsistency (LOW PRIORITY)
**Issue:** Mixed import patterns for similar functionality

**Examples:**
```typescript
// Some files use index exports
import { serviceA } from '@/lib/services'

// Others use direct imports
import { serviceB } from '@/lib/services/specific-service'
```

**Recommendation:**
```
CREATE → Barrel exports (index.ts files) for major directories
STANDARDIZE → Import patterns across codebase
DOCUMENT → Preferred import conventions
```

---

## 6. Hook Optimization Opportunities

### 6.1 Wait Time Hooks (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Issue:** Multiple overlapping wait time hooks

**Files:**
- `useWaitTimes.ts` (177 lines) - General wait times
- `useHistoricalWaitTimes.ts` (153 lines) - Historical data
- `useLiveWaitTimes.ts` (122 lines) - Real-time data
- `useWaitTimePredictor.ts` (327 lines) - Predictive analytics

**Analysis:**
- Some functionality could be consolidated
- Potential for shared logic extraction
- Performance impact of multiple similar hooks

**Recommendation:**
```
EVALUATE → Common patterns across wait time hooks
EXTRACT → Shared utilities to separate module
CONSIDER → Single useWaitTimes hook with options parameter
```

## 7. Data File Analysis

### 7.1 Large Static Data Files
**Files Requiring Review:**
- `src/lib/data/detailed-parks.ts` (1,914 lines) - Comprehensive park data
- `src/lib/data/restaurants.ts` (777 lines) - Restaurant definitions
- `src/lib/data/annual-events.ts` (345 lines) - Event data

**Analysis:**
- These files are appropriately sized for their purpose
- Well-structured and actively used
- Consider code-splitting for bundle optimization

**Recommendation:**
```
OPTIMIZE → Consider dynamic imports for large data files
SPLIT → Parks data by individual park if possible
COMPRESS → Evaluate JSON compression for production
```

---

## 8. Unused/Underutilized Files

### 8.1 Example Files (LOW PRIORITY)
**Files:**
- `src/examples/restaurant-database-usage.ts` (557 lines)
- Various example files in examples directory

**Recommendation:**
```
MOVE → Examples to separate documentation repository
CREATE → Link to examples in main repo README
REDUCE → Bundle size by removing from build
```

### 8.2 Legacy Files (AUDIT REQUIRED)
**Potential Candidates:**
- Test files that may not run
- Configuration files with unclear purpose
- Deprecated utility functions

**Recommendation:**
```
AUDIT → Each file for actual usage and necessity
DOCUMENT → Purpose of unclear configuration files
REMOVE → Confirmed unused files
```
