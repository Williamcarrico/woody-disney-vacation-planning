# Fixing React Hook useEffect Dependency Error (2025-05-27 11:56:52)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'syncChanges'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the error, the issue is that `syncChanges` is called inside the `useEffect` but isn't included in the dependency array. The linter is correctly identifying this missing dependency.

The problem is that `syncChanges` itself depends on `isOnline` and `checkPendingChanges`, which would create a dependency chain that could cause the effect to re-run frequently.

Here's the fix - add `syncChanges` to the dependency array:

The issue is that `syncChanges` is defined after this `useEffect`, so we can't reference it in the dependency array. Let me fix this by reordering the code:

Perfect! The fix is now complete. By moving the `syncChanges` function definition before the `useEffect` that uses it, we can properly include it in the dependency array without any linter errors.

**Summary of the fix:**
1. Moved `syncChanges` and `toggleOfflineMode` function definitions before the `useEffect` that uses `syncChanges`
2. Added `syncChanges` to the dependency array of the network status change handler

This resolves the missing dependency warning while maintaining the correct behavior of the hook.
