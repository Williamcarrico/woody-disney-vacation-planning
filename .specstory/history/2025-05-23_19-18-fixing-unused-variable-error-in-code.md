# Fixing Unused Variable Error in Code (2025-05-23 14:18:53)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'themeStyles' is declared but its value is never read.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Looking at the code, the `themeStyles` variable is declared but never used. The component is using `COMPONENT_THEMES.card[disneyTheme]` directly instead.

The simplest fix is to remove the unused variable:

Now I need to remove the unused import as well:

Perfect! I've resolved the linter error by:

1. **Removed the unused variable**: Deleted `const themeStyles = getThemeStyles(disneyTheme);` since it wasn't being used anywhere in the component
2. **Removed the unused import**: Removed `getThemeStyles` from the import statement since it's no longer needed

The component already uses `COMPONENT_THEMES.card[disneyTheme]` directly in the className assignments, so this change doesn't affect functionality while cleaning up the unused code.
