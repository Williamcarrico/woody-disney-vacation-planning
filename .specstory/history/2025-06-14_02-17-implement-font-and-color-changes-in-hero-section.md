Now I need to add the CSS styles for the Disney-inspired red, yellow, and blue color scheme. Let me add this to the globals.css file:

Perfect! I've successfully implemented the changes to use the Cabin Sketch Google Font for the WaltWise title in the Hero Section with Disney's classic red, yellow, and blue color scheme. Here's what I've done:

## Changes Made:

1. **Font Implementation**: 
   - Changed the title from `font-luckiest` to `cabin-sketch-bold` to use the Google Font you specified
   - The font classes you provided are already available in the globals.css file

2. **Disney Color Scheme**:
   - Replaced the previous shimmer effect with a new `hero-text-disney-colors` class
   - Implemented a beautiful gradient animation using Disney's classic colors:
     - **Red** (`#dc2626`) - Disney's signature red
     - **Yellow** (`#fbbf24`) - Disney's bright yellow
     - **Blue** (`#2563eb`) - Disney's royal blue

3. **Enhanced Animation**:
   - Created a `disney-shimmer` animation that smoothly transitions between the three colors
   - The gradient moves in a 4-second cycle, creating a dynamic, magical effect
   - Added subtle text shadow for better readability

4. **Dark Mode Support**:
   - Included brighter variants of the colors for dark mode to ensure good contrast
   - Enhanced text shadow in dark mode for better visibility

## Features:

- ✅ **Cabin Sketch Font**: Now using the Google Font you specified with bold weight
- ✅ **Disney Colors**: Red, yellow, and blue gradient animation
- ✅ **Smooth Animation**: 4-second cycling shimmer effect
- ✅ **Accessibility**: Proper contrast in both light and dark modes
- ✅ **Responsive**: Works across all screen sizes
- ✅ **Performance**: Optimized CSS animations

The WaltWise title now has that authentic Disney feel with the playful Cabin Sketch font and the classic Disney color palette, while maintaining all the other existing elements and functionality of your Hero Section!
