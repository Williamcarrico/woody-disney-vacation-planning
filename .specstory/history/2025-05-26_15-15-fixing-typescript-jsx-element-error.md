# Fixing TypeScript JSX Element Error (2025-05-26 10:15:39)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Cannot find name 'path'. Did you mean 'pathD'?
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the linter errors, the issue is that TypeScript doesn't recognize the JSX elements `svg`, `path`, and `defs` as valid HTML elements. This is a TypeScript configuration issue, not a problem with your code.

The fix is to add the React JSX types. Add this import at the top of your file:

The error occurs because TypeScript needs the React namespace to recognize JSX elements like `<svg>`, `<path>`, and `<defs>`. By importing `React` explicitly, TypeScript will now properly recognize these as valid JSX elements rather than undefined variables.

This is a common issue when using newer React versions with TypeScript where the automatic JSX runtime might not be properly configured for SVG elements.
