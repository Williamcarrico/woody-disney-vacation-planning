_**Assistant**_

I'll help you fix these ESLint errors in the `LocationSharing.tsx` component. The errors are related to unused variables and missing dependencies in the `useEffect` hook.

I need to fix the dependency issue by using `useCallback` to memoize the `getCurrentLocation` function and move it before the `useEffect`:

---



---

Now I need to wrap `getCurrentLocation` with `useCallback` and move it before the `useEffect`:

---



---

Now I need to fix the unused `err` variables in the catch blocks by prefixing them with underscore:

---



---

I need to use a different approach. Let me remove the catch parameter entirely since it's not being used:

Perfect! I've successfully fixed all the ESLint errors in the `LocationSharing.tsx` component:

## Summary of Changes Made:

1. **Removed unused `error` variable** from the destructured `useLocationSharing` hook since it wasn't being used anywhere in the component.

2. **Fixed React Hook dependency warning** by:
   - Adding `useCallback` import
   - Wrapping `getCurrentLocation` function with `useCallback` and adding `isSharing` as a dependency
   - Moving the function definition before the `useEffect` that uses it
   - Adding all necessary dependencies to the `useEffect` dependency array

3. **Fixed unused `err` variables** in catch blocks by removing the parameter entirely since the error wasn't being used (just showing a generic toast message).

The component now follows React best practices with proper dependency management and has no ESLint warnings. The `getCurrentLocation` function is properly memoized to prevent unnecessary re-renders, and all variables are being used appropriately.

According to the [TypeScript ESLint documentation](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/no-unused-vars/), this rule helps catch unused variables that can add unnecessary code complexity. By removing unused variables and properly managing dependencies, the code is now cleaner and more maintainable.
