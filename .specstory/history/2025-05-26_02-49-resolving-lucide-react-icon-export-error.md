# Resolving Lucide-React Icon Export Error (2025-05-25 21:49:58)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Module '"lucide-react"' has no exported member 'Paw'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

The `Paw` icon doesn't exist in lucide-react. I'll replace it with `PawPrint` which is the correct icon name.

---



---

Now I need to update the usage of `Paw` to `PawPrint` in the lands array:

---



---

I see there's still a reference to `Paw` somewhere. Let me search for it:

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "Paw" â€¢ **2** files</summary>

The search shows the changes were applied correctly. Let me check if there are any other references by looking at the current file content around line 452:

---

Read file: src/app/dashboard/parks/animal-kingdom/page.tsx

---

The code looks correct now. Let me run a quick check to see if there are any remaining linter errors by running the terminal command to check the file:

---

```bash
cd "/Users/williamcarrico/Web App Design/woody-disney-vacation-planning" && npx eslint src/app/dashboard/parks/animal-kingdom/page.tsx --format=compact
```

```
The compact formatter is no longer part of core ESLint. Install it manually with
 `npm install -D eslint-form
atter-compact`
                            
```

---

Let me try a simpler approach to check the TypeScript errors:

---

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit --project . | grep "animal-kingdom/page.tsx"
```

```
williamcarrico@CIA woody-disney-vacation-planning % npx tsc --noEmit --project . | grep "animal-kingdom/page
.tsx"                                               npx tsc --noEmit --project . | grep "animal-kingdom/page
.tsx"
```
