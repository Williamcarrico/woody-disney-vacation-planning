The error occurs because `JSON.parse()` returns `any` by default. Here's a concise fix:

---

This change casts the result as `unknown` instead of `any`, which is safer and satisfies TypeScript's strict typing requirements. The `bulkImporter.importFromData` function should handle the validation of the data structure internally.

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'border-2' applies the same CSS properties as 'border-muted-foreground/25'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_



---

The error occurs because `border-2` and `border-muted-foreground/25` both apply border properties. Here's the fix:

---



---

This replaces `border-2` with `border` to avoid the conflict. The `border` class sets a 1px border width, while `border-dashed` sets the style and `border-muted-foreground/25` sets the color with opacity.
