# Fixing TypeScript Unexpected Any Error (2025-05-27 12:42:21)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Unexpected any. Specify a different type.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the linter error, the issue is with using `any` type in the JSX IntrinsicElements interface. This can be resolved by using a more specific type that allows for HTML attributes.

---

The fix replaces `any` with `React.DetailedHTMLProps<React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLElement>, HTMLElement>`, which is the proper TypeScript type for HTML element props in React. This maintains type safety while allowing custom elements to have standard HTML attributes.
