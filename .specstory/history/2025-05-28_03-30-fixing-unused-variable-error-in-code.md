# Fixing Unused Variable Error in Code (2025-05-27 22:30:32)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'aiInsights' is declared but its value is never read.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the code, I can see that `aiInsights` is destructured from `usePersonalizedContent()` on line 415 but is never used in the component. Here's a concise fix:

---

```diff
      const scale = useTransform(scrollYProgress, [0, 0.5], [0.8, 1])
      const rotateX = useTransform(scrollYProgress, [0, 1], [15, 0])
-     const { userPreferences, recommendations, aiInsights } = usePersonalizedContent()
+     const { userPreferences, recommendations } = usePersonalizedContent()
  
      // Dynamic theme based on time with enhanced logic
```

---

The fix is simple: I removed `aiInsights` from the destructuring assignment since it's not being used anywhere in the component. This resolves the linting error while keeping the code clean and functional.

If you plan to use `aiInsights` later (perhaps to display AI-generated insights in the footer), you can add it back when you implement that functionality.
