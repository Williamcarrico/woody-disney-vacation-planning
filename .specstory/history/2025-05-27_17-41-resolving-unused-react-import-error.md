# Resolving Unused React Import Error (2025-05-27 12:41:42)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'React' is defined but never used.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the linter error, the `React` import is indeed unused in this JSX declaration file. Since you're only extending the global JSX namespace and not using React directly, you can simply remove the import.

The fix removes the unused React import. The JSX namespace extension works without needing to import React directly, as TypeScript's JSX support is built-in and React's types are already available globally in a React project.

Unexpected any. Specify a different type.

_**Assistant**_

The linter is complaining about the `any` type. Since this is for custom JSX elements, you can use a more specific type that allows any props but maintains type safety:

Wait, I need to add the React import back since we're now using React types:

---

The fix replaces `any` with `React.DetailedHTMLProps<React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLElement>, HTMLElement>`, which provides proper typing for custom HTML elements while maintaining flexibility. This allows custom elements to accept standard HTML attributes in a type-safe way.
