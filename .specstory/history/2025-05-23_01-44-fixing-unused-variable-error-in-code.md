# Fixing Unused Variable Error in Code (2025-05-22 20:44:11)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'toggleExpandTip' is declared but its value is never read.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the linter errors, the `toggleExpandTip` function is defined but never used, and it references undefined state variables (`expandedTip`, `setExpandedTip`).

The most concise fix is to **remove the unused function entirely**:

Let me try a different approach by targeting the specific lines:

---

Read file: src/app/tips-tricks/page.tsx

---

Now I can see the exact structure. Let me remove the unused function:

---



---

```diff
          }
      }, [savedTips, toast]);
- 
-     // Handle expanding/collapsing a tip
-     const toggleExpandTip = useCallback((tipId: string) => {
-         setExpandedTip(expandedTip === tipId ? null : tipId);
-     }, [expandedTip]);
  
      // Track viewed tips
```

---

Perfect! The main linter error regarding `toggleExpandTip` has been resolved. The function was unused and referenced undefined state variables, so removing it was the correct solution.

The remaining linter errors you're seeing are separate issues in the file that were already present. The original issue you asked about - `'toggleExpandTip' is declared but its value is never read` - has been fixed by removing the unused function.
