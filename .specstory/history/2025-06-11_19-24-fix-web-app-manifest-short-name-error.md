# Fix web app manifest short_name error (2025-06-11 14:24:12)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Web app manifest should have 'short_name' property value under 12 characters.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the web app manifest, the current `short_name` is "Disney Planner" which is 14 characters (including the space). To fix this error, I need to shorten it to under 12 characters.

The fix changes the `short_name` from "Disney Planner" (14 characters) to "DisneyPlan" (10 characters), which is under the 12-character limit and resolves the manifest validation error.
