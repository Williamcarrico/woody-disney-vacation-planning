# Fixing TypeScript Empty Interface Error (2025-05-27 12:28:15)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the error, this is from the ESLint rule `@typescript-eslint/no-empty-interface`. The interface `ScrollProgressProps` is empty and only extends another type, which the linter considers equivalent to a type alias.

The fix converts the empty interface that only extends another type into a type alias, which is semantically equivalent and resolves the linter error. This is the recommended approach when you have an interface that declares no additional members beyond what it extends.
