I can see the issue. The `setCookiesEssential` function is declared but never used in the component. Looking at the code, this makes sense because the "Essential Cookies" switch is disabled (as it should be - essential cookies can't be turned off), so there's no need for the setter function.

Let me fix this by removing the unused setter:

Perfect! I've fixed the ESLint error by removing the unused `setCookiesEssential` setter function. Since the essential cookies switch is disabled (as shown by the `disabled` prop on the Switch component), the setter function isn't needed. The component will still work correctly - the `cookiesEssential` state will remain `true` and the switch will be disabled, which is the intended behavior for essential cookies that cannot be turned off.

The fix follows the ESLint rule's guidance from the documentation: when a variable is only declared but never used (in this case, the setter function), it should be removed to keep the code clean and avoid confusion.
