# Fixing Missing Argument Error in Code (2025-05-24 12:33:09)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Expected 1 arguments, but got 0.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Looking at the linter error, the issue is that `useRef<number>()` expects an initial value when a type is specified. Here's the fix:

---

```diff
  export default function ParticleField({ theme }: ParticleFieldProps) {
      const containerRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null)
-     const animationRef = useRef<number>()
+     const animationRef = useRef<number | undefined>(undefined)
      const particlesRef = useRef<Particle[]>([])
  
```

```diff
          const animate = () => {
              particlesRef.current = particlesRef.current.map(particle => {
-                 let { x, y, speedX, speedY } = particle
- 
-                 x += speedX
-                 y += speedY
+                 const { x: currentX, y: currentY, speedX, speedY } = particle
+                 
+                 let x = currentX + speedX
+                 let y = currentY + speedY
  
                  // Wrap around edges
```

---

The fix addresses both linter errors:

1. **`useRef<number>()` error**: Changed to `useRef<number | undefined>(undefined)` to provide the expected initial value
2. **`const` instead of `let` error**: Restructured the destructuring to use `const` for `speedX` and `speedY` while properly declaring `x` and `y` as `let` since they are reassigned

This maintains the same functionality while satisfying TypeScript's type requirements.
