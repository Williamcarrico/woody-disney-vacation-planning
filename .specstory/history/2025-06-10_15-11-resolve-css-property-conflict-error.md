# Resolve CSS property conflict error (2025-06-10 10:11:42)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'border-red-400/70' applies the same CSS properties as 'border-2'.

How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

The linter is still complaining. Let me try using Tailwind's style prop approach instead:

Perfect! The fix replaces the conflicting Tailwind classes with an inline style that achieves the same visual result. This resolves the linter error by avoiding the class name conflict while maintaining the 2px solid red border with 70% opacity.
