I see you encountered an error where the Anthropic model provider ended the response early. This appears to be a technical issue with the Cursor IDE's AI integration rather than a code-related problem.

From the attached files, I can see you have an impressive Disney-themed theming system implemented! Your theme provider includes:

âœ¨ **Disney-Inspired Themes:**
- Magical Day (light)
- Starlit Night (dark) 
- Castle Dreams (royal amber)
- Space Mountain (cosmic cyan)
- Under the Sea (ocean emerald)

ðŸŽ¨ **Advanced Features:**
- Smooth animations with accessibility controls
- Comprehensive component theming
- Enhanced accessibility (WCAG AA compliant)
- Auto theme switching
- Persistent preferences
- TypeScript support

If you were working on something specific with your theming system when the error occurred, I'd be happy to help! Some areas I could assist with:

1. **Theme Integration** - Help integrate the theme system into new components
2. **Accessibility Improvements** - Enhance the already strong accessibility features
3. **Performance Optimization** - Optimize theme transitions and animations
4. **Custom Theme Creation** - Add new Disney-inspired themes
5. **Component Theming** - Create theme-aware variants for specific components

Was there something specific you were trying to accomplish with your theming system when the error occurred? I can help you continue where you left off!
