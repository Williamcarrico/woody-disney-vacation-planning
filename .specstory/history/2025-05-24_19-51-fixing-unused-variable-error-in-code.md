# Fixing Unused Variable Error in Code (2025-05-24 14:51:26)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'autoPlayProgress' is declared but its value is never read.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_



---

The error occurs because `autoPlayProgress` and `setAutoPlayProgress` are declared but never used in the code. 

**Concise fix:** Remove the unused state variable:

---

```diff
    const [selectedFeature, setSelectedFeature] = useState(0);
    const [isAutoPlay, setIsAutoPlay] = useState(true);
-   const [autoPlayProgress, setAutoPlayProgress] = useState(0);
    const { playSound } = useSound();
  
```

---

The linter error is now resolved by removing the unused `autoPlayProgress` state variable that wasn't being referenced anywhere in the component.
