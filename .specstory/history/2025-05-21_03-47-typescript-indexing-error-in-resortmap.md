Read file: src/types/resort.ts

---

The error is happening because you're missing the "Value Plus" category in your categoryColorMap objects. According to your types definition in `src/types/resort.ts`, the `ResortCategory` enum includes a `ValuePlus` value that isn't accounted for in your color mappings.

Let's fix this by updating both categoryColorMap objects in your ResortMap.tsx file:

---



---

Now let's update the second categoryColorMap object:

---

Now let's also update the getCategoryColor function to include the ValuePlus category:

I've fixed the TypeScript errors by adding the missing `ValuePlus` resort category to:

1. Both categoryColorMap objects
2. The getCategoryColor function

I used cyan colors for the Value Plus category to provide a distinct but related color to the Value category (blue). The colors follow the same pattern as the existing categories, with appropriate styling for both light and dark modes.
