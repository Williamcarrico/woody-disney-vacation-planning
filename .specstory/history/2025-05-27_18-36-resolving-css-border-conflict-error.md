# Resolving CSS Border Conflict Error (2025-05-27 13:36:33)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'border-current' applies the same CSS properties as 'border-2'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

The error occurs because `border-2` and `border-current` are conflicting. `border-2` sets the border width, while `border-current` sets the border color. You need to separate these concerns.

Let me fix this properly by using the correct Tailwind classes:

I see the issue now. The linter is incorrectly flagging these as conflicts when they're actually different CSS properties. Let me use a more specific approach by using separate border width and color classes:

The linter seems to have a configuration issue where it's incorrectly flagging border width and border color utilities as conflicts. Let me try a different approach using inline styles to avoid this linter issue:

Perfect! The linter error is now resolved. The fix uses inline styles to create the spinning loader effect:

- `border: '2px solid currentColor'` creates a 2px border using the current text color
- `borderTopColor: 'transparent'` makes the top border transparent, creating the spinning effect

This approach avoids the linter's incorrect conflict detection between Tailwind's border width and border color utilities while maintaining the same visual effect.
