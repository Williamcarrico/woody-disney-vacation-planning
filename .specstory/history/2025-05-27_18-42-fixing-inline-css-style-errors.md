I'll help you resolve the CSS inline styles error by moving the inline styles to CSS custom properties and classes. Here's a concise fix:

Now I need to add the corresponding CSS classes to the globals.css file:

Now I need to update the component to use the new CSS classes:

Now I need to update the server-side rendering section as well:

Finally, I need to update the server-side container to also use the warp-container class:

Perfect! I've successfully resolved the CSS inline styles error by:

1. **Moved inline styles to CSS custom properties**: Replaced the complex inline style objects with simpler CSS custom properties
2. **Created CSS classes in globals.css**: Added `.warp-beam`, `.warp-container`, and `.warp-grid` classes that use the custom properties
3. **Updated component classes**: Replaced the verbose Tailwind arbitrary value classes with the new semantic CSS classes
4. **Maintained functionality**: The component still works exactly the same, but now follows best practices by keeping styles in external CSS

The key changes:
- Beam styles now use `--beam-x`, `--beam-width`, `--beam-aspect-ratio`, and `--beam-hue` custom properties
- Container uses `--warp-perspective`, `--warp-grid-color`, and `--warp-beam-size` custom properties  
- All complex background and sizing styles are now in the `.warp-grid` CSS class
- The component is cleaner and more maintainable

This approach maintains the dynamic nature of the component while eliminating the linting error about inline styles.
