# Fixing Inline CSS Error (2025-05-22 21:04:26)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
CSS inline styles should not be used, move styles to an external CSS file
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Looking at the error, you have an inline style on line 2052. The fix is simple - Tailwind CSS has a utility class for this.

```diff
                      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-800 dark:text-indigo-200 mb-6">Recently Viewed Tips</h2>
                      <div className="overflow-x-auto pb-4">
-                         <div className="flex gap-4" style={{ minWidth: 'max-content' }}>
+                         <div className="flex gap-4 min-w-max">
                              {recentlyViewedTips.map((tip, index) => (
                                  <div key={`recent-${index}`} className="w-80 flex-shrink-0">
```

The fix is complete! I replaced the inline style `style={{ minWidth: 'max-content' }}` with the Tailwind CSS utility class `min-w-max`, which provides the same functionality without using inline styles. This follows the best practice of keeping styles in CSS classes rather than inline.
