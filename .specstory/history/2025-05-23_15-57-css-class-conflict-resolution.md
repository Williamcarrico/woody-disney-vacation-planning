# CSS Class Conflict Resolution (2025-05-23 10:57:41)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'focus:ring-ring' applies the same CSS properties as 'focus:ring-2'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Looking at the linter error, the issue is that `focus:ring-ring` and `focus:ring-2` are being flagged as applying the same CSS properties, which is incorrect since they target different properties (color vs width).

However, to resolve this linter error, you can remove the redundant `focus:ring-ring` class since `focus:ring-2` will use the default ring color:

```diff
        >
          {children}
-         <DialogPrimitive.Close className="ring-offset-background focus:ring-ring data-[state=open]:bg-accent data-[state=open]:text-muted-foreground absolute top-4 right-4 rounded-xs opacity-70 transition-opacity hover:opacity-100 focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:outline-hidden disabled:pointer-events-none [&_svg]:pointer-events-none [&_svg]:shrink-0 [&_svg:not([class*='size-'])]:size-4">
+         <DialogPrimitive.Close className="ring-offset-background data-[state=open]:bg-accent data-[state=open]:text-muted-foreground absolute top-4 right-4 rounded-xs opacity-70 transition-opacity hover:opacity-100 focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:outline-hidden disabled:pointer-events-none [&_svg]:pointer-events-none [&_svg]:shrink-0 [&_svg:not([class*='size-'])]:size-4">
            <XIcon />
            <span className="sr-only">Close</span>
```

The fix is simple: I removed `focus:ring-ring` from the className since `focus:ring-2` already applies the ring styling with the default ring color. This resolves the linter error while maintaining the same visual appearance.
