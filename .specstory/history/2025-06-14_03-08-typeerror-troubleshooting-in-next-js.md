# TypeError troubleshooting in Next.js (2025-06-13 22:08:02)

TypeError: Failed to fetch

I can see you're encountering a "Failed to fetch" error related to server actions in Next.js. This typically occurs when server actions can't be reached due to configuration issues. Let me investigate the current state of your codebase to identify the problem.

Based on my analysis, the "TypeError: Failed to fetch" error is being caused by the Content Security Policy (CSP) in your middleware blocking server actions. The issue is that the current CSP configuration doesn't allow the internal requests that Next.js server actions make.

Here's the problem and solution:

## The Issue

Your middleware is setting a Content Security Policy that's too restrictive for server actions. Server actions in Next.js need to make internal requests to work properly, but your current CSP `connect-src` directive doesn't allow these requests.

## The Solution

I need to update your middleware to allow server actions to work properly. Here's the fix:

---

Now I need to also modify the middleware to skip CSP for server action requests, which Next.js makes internally:

---

The changes I made should resolve the server action fetch error:

## What Was Fixed

1. **CSP Headers for Server Actions**: The middleware was applying strict Content Security Policy headers that blocked Next.js server actions from making internal requests.

2. **Server Action Detection**: Added logic to detect server action requests and skip applying CSP headers to them, since server actions use special internal request mechanisms.

3. **Weather API Support**: Added `https://api.tomorrow.io` to the `connect-src` directive for your weather API integration.

4. **CSP Separator Fix**: Fixed the CSP join separator to use '; ' (with space) instead of ';' for proper formatting.

## Why This Fixes the Error

The "TypeError: Failed to fetch" error was occurring because:
- Your server action `getHeroGradientData` was trying to make internal Next.js requests
- The middleware's CSP was blocking these requests
- Next.js server actions need special handling and can't be restricted by normal CSP rules

## Next Steps

1. **Test the fix** by refreshing your application - the server action should now work properly
2. **Monitor the browser console** to ensure no other CSP violations are occurring
3. **Verify** that your hero gradient component is now loading data correctly

The server action should now be able to fetch data without the "Failed to fetch" error. The middleware will continue to apply security headers to regular requests while allowing server actions to function properly.
