I'll help you optimize, enhance, and update the Disney Springs files using the comprehensive JSON data you provided, and create a Firebase Database structure. Let me start by analyzing the current implementation and then systematically update each component.

```diff

+ - **Performance Optimization**: Memoized filtering, lazy loading, and efficient re-renders
+ 
+ ## 🚀 Quick Start
+ 
+ ### Prerequisites
+ - Node.js 18+ installed
+ - Firebase project configured
+ - Environment variables set up
+ 
+ ### 1. Setup Firebase Configuration
+ 
+ Make sure your Firebase configuration is properly set up in `src/lib/firebase/index.ts` and your environment variables are configured.
+ 
+ ### 2. Initialize Disney Springs Data
+ 
+ Run the setup script to populate your Firebase database:
+ 
+ ```bash
+ # Using npm
+ npx ts-node src/scripts/setup-disney-springs.ts
+ 
+ # Using yarn
+ yarn ts-node src/scripts/setup-disney-springs.ts
+ ```
+ 
+ This will:
+ - Transform the comprehensive JSON data into Firebase-compatible format
+ - Create all necessary Firestore collections
+ - Populate the database with locations, metadata, and operational information
+ - Set up proper indexing for efficient queries
+ 
+ ### 3. Verify Setup
+ 
+ Navigate to `/dashboard/disneysprings` in your application to see the enhanced Disney Springs experience.

+ ```
+ 
+ ## 🎯 Usage Guide
+ 
+ ### Basic Components
+ 
+ #### Main Disney Springs Page
+ ```tsx
+ import DisneySpringsPage from '@/app/dashboard/disneysprings/page'
+ 
+ // The page automatically handles:
+ // - Data fetching from Firebase
+ // - Advanced filtering and search
+ // - Loading and error states
+ // - Responsive design
+ ```
+ 
+ #### Using React Hooks
+ ```tsx
+ import {
+   useDisneySpringsLocations,
+   useDisneySpringsLocationsByCategory,
+   useDisneySpringsMetadata
+ } from '@/lib/utils/disneySpringsData'
+ 
+ function MyComponent() {
+   const { locations, loading, error } = useDisneySpringsLocations()
+   const { metadata } = useDisneySpringsMetadata()
+ 
+   if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>
+   if (error) return <div>Error: {error}</div>
+ 
+   return (
+     <div>
+       <h1>{metadata?.name}</h1>
+       <p>Found {locations.length} locations</p>
+     </div>
+   )
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ #### Advanced Filtering
+ ```tsx
+ import { searchDisneySpringsLocations } from '@/lib/firebase/disneysprings'
+ import { LocationCategory, LocationArea, PriceRange } from '@/types/disneysprings'
+ 
+ const filters = {
+   category: LocationCategory.Dining,
+   area: LocationArea.TheLanding,
+   priceRanges: [PriceRange.High, PriceRange.VeryHigh],
+   features: ['Waterfront dining', 'Celebrity chef'],
+   searchTerm: 'seafood'
+ }
+ 
+ const results = await searchDisneySpringsLocations(filters)
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Firebase Service Functions
+ 
+ #### Basic Data Retrieval
+ ```tsx
+ import {
+   getAllDisneySpringsLocations,
+   getLocationsByCategory,
+   getDisneySpringsLocationById
+ } from '@/lib/firebase/disneysprings'
+ 
+ // Get all locations
+ const locations = await getAllDisneySpringsLocations()
+ 
+ // Get locations by category
+ const restaurants = await getLocationsByCategory(LocationCategory.Dining)
+ 
+ // Get specific location
+ const location = await getDisneySpringsLocationById('world-of-disney')
+ ```
+ 
+ #### Metadata & Operational Information
+ ```tsx
+ import {
+   getDisneySpringsMetadata,
+   getOperationalInfo,
+   getDisneySpringsEvents
+ } from '@/lib/firebase/disneysprings'
+ 
+ const metadata = await getDisneySpringsMetadata()
+ const operationalInfo = await getOperationalInfo()
+ const events = await getDisneySpringsEvents()
+ ```
+ 
+ ## 🔧 Customization
+ 
+ ### Adding New Locations
+ ```tsx
+ import { addDisneySpringsLocation } from '@/lib/firebase/disneysprings'
+ 
+ const newLocation = {
+   name: "New Restaurant",
+   description: "Amazing new dining experience",
+   category: LocationCategory.Dining,
+   area: LocationArea.TownCenter,
+   tags: ["Fine dining", "Modern cuisine"],
+   imageUrl: "/images/new-restaurant.jpg",
+   // ... other properties
+ }
+ 
+ const locationId = await addDisneySpringsLocation(newLocation)
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Custom Filtering
+ ```tsx
+ import { filterLocationsByCategory, getLocationsByTags } from '@/lib/utils/disneySpringsData'
+ 
+ // Custom filter combinations
+ const familyFriendlyRestaurants = locations
+   .filter(loc => loc.category === LocationCategory.Dining)
+   .filter(loc => getLocationsByTags([loc], ['Family-friendly']).length > 0)
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Extending Types
+ ```tsx
+ // In src/types/disneysprings.ts
+ export interface CustomLocationExtension extends DisneySpringLocation {
+   customField: string
+   additionalData: Record<string, any>
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ ## 🛡️ Firestore Security Rules
+ 
+ Ensure your Firestore has appropriate security rules:
+ 
+ ```javascript
+ rules_version = '2';
+ service cloud.firestore {
+   match /databases/{database}/documents {
+     // Disney Springs collections - read-only for authenticated users
+     match /disney_springs_{collection}/{document} {
+       allow read: if request.auth != null;
+       allow write: if request.auth != null &&
+         request.auth.token.admin == true; // Admin only writes
+     }
+   }
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ ## 📊 Data Schema
+ 
+ ### Location Document Structure
+ ```typescript
+ {
+   id: string
+   name: string
+   description: string
+   category: "Shopping" | "Dining" | "Entertainment"
+   area: "Marketplace" | "The Landing" | "Town Center" | "West Side"
+   tags: string[]
+   imageUrl: string
+   features?: string[]
+   specialties?: string[]
+   priceRange?: "$" | "$$" | "$$$" | "$$$$"
+   popular?: boolean
+   isNew?: boolean
+   hours?: string
+   phoneNumber?: string
+   // ... additional fields based on category
+   createdAt: Timestamp
+   updatedAt: Timestamp
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Collections Structure
+ - `disney_springs_locations` - Individual location documents
+ - `disney_springs_metadata` - Main Disney Springs information
+ - `disney_springs_operational` - Hours, parking, transportation
+ - `disney_springs_districts` - District information
+ - `disney_springs_events` - Seasonal and regular events
+ - `disney_springs_services` - Visitor services and amenities
+ - `disney_springs_tips` - Helpful visitor tips
+ 
+ ## 🔍 Troubleshooting
+ 
+ ### Common Issues
+ 
+ 1. **Firebase Connection Issues**
+    ```bash
+    # Check Firebase configuration
+    firebase projects:list
+    firebase use <project-id>
+    ```
+ 
+ 2. **Data Not Loading**
+    - Verify Firebase security rules allow read access
+    - Check browser console for errors
+    - Ensure API keys are properly configured
+ 
+ 3. **Performance Issues**
+    - Clear cache: `clearDisneySpringsCache()`
+    - Check network requests in DevTools
+    - Verify Firestore indexes are created
+ 
+ ### Debug Mode
+ ```tsx
+ import { clearDisneySpringsCache } from '@/lib/firebase/disneysprings'
+ 
+ // Clear cache if data seems stale
+ clearDisneySpringsCache()
+ ```
+ 
+ ## 🚀 Performance Optimization
+ 
+ - **Caching**: 5-minute cache for frequently accessed data
+ - **Memoization**: React hooks use memoized filtering
+ - **Lazy Loading**: Components load data on demand
+ - **Pagination**: Large datasets support pagination
+ - **Indexing**: Firestore indexes for efficient queries
+ 
+ ## 📱 Responsive Design
+ 
+ The implementation is fully responsive with:
+ - Mobile-first design approach
+ - Touch-friendly interface elements
+ - Optimized images and loading states
+ - Accessible navigation and controls
+ 
+ ## ♿ Accessibility
+ 
+ - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
+ - Keyboard navigation support
+ - Screen reader compatibility
+ - High contrast color schemes
+ - Semantic HTML structure
+ 
+ ## 🤝 Contributing
+ 
+ When adding new features or locations:
+ 
+ 1. Update TypeScript types first
+ 2. Add Firebase service functions
+ 3. Create/update React components
+ 4. Add comprehensive documentation
+ 5. Test across different screen sizes
+ 6. Verify accessibility compliance
+ 
+ ## 📄 License
+ 
+ This implementation is part of the larger vacation planning application and follows the same licensing terms.
