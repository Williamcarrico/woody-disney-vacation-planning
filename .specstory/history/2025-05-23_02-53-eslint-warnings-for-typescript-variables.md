Looking at the linter errors in the `animated-beam.tsx` file, I can see two issues:

1. The `entry` variable is declared with `let` but never reassigned (should use `const`)
2. The `entry` variable is assigned but never used in the loop body

The issue is in the ResizeObserver callback where we're looping through entries but not actually using the `entry` variable. Since `updatePath()` recalculates the entire path and doesn't need individual entry data, we can simplify this.

---

```diff
          // Initialize ResizeObserver
          const resizeObserver = new ResizeObserver((entries) => {
-             // For all entries, recalculate the path
-             for (let entry of entries) {
+             // If there are any resize entries, recalculate the path
+             if (entries.length > 0) {
                  updatePath();
              }
```

---

The fix I've applied addresses both linter errors:

1. **Removed the unused variable**: The `entry` variable was declared but never used since we only need to call `updatePath()` when any resize occurs
2. **Simplified the logic**: Instead of looping through each entry and calling `updatePath()` multiple times (which would be redundant), we now just check if there are any entries and call `updatePath()` once

This is more efficient and follows the ESLint rules. The ResizeObserver callback will still fire whenever the container resizes, and `updatePath()` will recalculate the beam path accordingly.

Based on the [ESLint documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/no-unused-vars), this follows best practices by eliminating unused variables that can lead to confusion and take up unnecessary space in the code.
