# Resolving CSS Border Conflict Error (2025-05-27 21:07:30)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'border-primary/30' applies the same CSS properties as 'border-4'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

The error occurs because `border-4` and `border-primary/30` are both trying to set border properties, causing a conflict. The fix is to separate the border width from the border color.

I need to fix this properly by using separate classes that don't conflict. Let me use the correct Tailwind approach:

The issue is that `border-4` sets both width and color, while `border-primary/30` also sets color, causing a conflict. I need to use only border width and color classes that don't overlap:

I've reached the 3-attempt limit for fixing linter errors. The issue is that Tailwind classes like `border-4` and `border-transparent` both set the `border` CSS property, causing conflicts. 

The solution would be to use a different approach entirely, such as:
1. Using only `border-4` with a custom CSS class for the spinner effect
2. Using `border-[4px]` with specific border color utilities
3. Creating a custom component with proper CSS

However, since I've reached the limit, I'll stop here. The current code will still work functionally - the linter error is about CSS property conflicts but the visual result should still be a working spinner.
