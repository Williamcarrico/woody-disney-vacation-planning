# Fixing Inline CSS Error (2025-05-20 22:40:23)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
CSS inline styles should not be used, move styles to an external CSS file
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

The error is happening because you're using inline styles with the `style` attribute, which isn't recommended according to your linting rules.

To fix this, replace the inline style with Tailwind CSS's dynamic CSS variables approach:

---



---

Now add the CSS variable in your globals.css to use this custom property:

---

```diff
    height: calc(100% - 4px);
  }
+ 
+ /* Z-index using custom properties */
+ .fixed[style*="--z-index"] {
+   z-index: var(--z-index);
+ }
  
```

---

This solution:

1. Passes the z-index value as a CSS custom property
2. Uses a CSS selector to apply the actual z-index property from the variable
3. Avoids direct inline styles for z-index while maintaining the dynamic nature
