For the code present, we get this error:
```
'ring-primary/40' applies the same CSS properties as 'ring-2'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the error, this appears to be a false positive from the Tailwind CSS IntelliSense extension. The `ring-2` sets the ring width, while `ring-primary/40` sets the ring color - they're complementary, not conflicting.

Here's a concise fix to resolve the linter warning:

This fix uses the arbitrary value syntax `ring-[2px]` instead of `ring-2`. Both accomplish the same visual result (a 2px ring), but the arbitrary value syntax avoids the false positive warning from the linter.

The warning was occurring because the linter was incorrectly detecting a conflict between:
- `ring-2` (sets ring width)
- `ring-primary/40` (sets ring color with opacity)

These are actually complementary utilities that work together, not conflicting ones. The arbitrary value syntax bypasses this detection issue while maintaining the same styling.
