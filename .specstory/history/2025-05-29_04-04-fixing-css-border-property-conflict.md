# Fixing CSS Border Property Conflict (2025-05-28 23:04:28)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'border-current' applies the same CSS properties as 'border-2'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

The linter is indicating that the `border-current` class is redundant because `border-2` likely already applies `border-color: currentColor` by default (or inherits it from the base styles where `borderColor.DEFAULT` is often `currentColor`).

To resolve this, you can remove the `border-current` class. The `border-2` class will set the border width, and the border color will default to the current text color for the left, right, and bottom borders, while `border-t-transparent` will make the top border transparent, achieving the desired spinner effect.

I'll make this change for you.

```diff

                                      <>
-                                         <div className="mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin rounded-full border-2 border-current border-t-transparent"></div>
+                                         <div className="mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin rounded-full border-2 border-t-transparent"></div>
                                          Logging out...
                                      </>
```

The redundant `border-current` class has been removed from the spinner `div` in `src/app/(auth)/logout/page.tsx`. This should resolve the linter error.
