# Replace navbar import with header import (2025-06-11 15:34:40)

Replace this Navbar import with Header import.

_**Assistant**_

I'll replace the Navbar import with Header import in the layout file.

I need to also update the component usage from `<Navbar />` to `<Header />` in the JSX.

Perfect! I've successfully replaced the Navbar import with Header import and updated the component usage in the JSX. The changes are:

1. Changed `import Navbar from "@/components/shared/Navbar";` to `import Header from "@/components/shared/Header";`
2. Changed `<Navbar />` to `<Header />` in the JSX

The linter errors have been resolved and the layout now uses the Header component instead of Navbar.
