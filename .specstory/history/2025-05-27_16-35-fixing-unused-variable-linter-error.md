I'll fix the linter error by removing the unused `err` variable in the catch block since it's not being used.

The linter error has been fixed by removing the unused `err` parameter from the catch block. Since the error wasn't being used in the catch block (only a generic error message was being shown), it's safe to omit the error parameter entirely. This follows the ESLint rule that prevents unused variables from cluttering the code.
