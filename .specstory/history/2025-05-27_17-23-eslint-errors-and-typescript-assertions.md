_**Assistant**_

I can see the linter error you're encountering. The `useMemo` import is unused in the `warp-background.tsx` file. Let me fix this by removing the unused import.

Perfect! I've removed the unused `useMemo` import from the React imports. This should resolve the `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` linter error you were seeing.

The error was occurring because `useMemo` was imported but never actually used anywhere in the component code. This is a common issue that can happen during development when you initially plan to use a hook but then implement the logic differently.

The other warnings you're seeing (about inline styles and TypeScript assertions) are from different linters and are more informational/stylistic rather than actual errors that would prevent your code from working.
