I'll fix that syntax error for you. There's an unescaped apostrophe in the string on line 394.

---



---

Fixed the syntax error by properly escaping the apostrophe in "Epcot's garden spaces". When using single quotes to define a string in JavaScript, any apostrophes within the string need to be escaped with a backslash (`\'`).

The page should now compile without this error.
