# Fixing Inline CSS Error (2025-05-23 14:15:33)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
CSS inline styles should not be used, move styles to an external CSS file
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

The error is caused by the inline `style={{ backgroundColor: config.accent }}` in the ThemeSelector component. Since you're already using CSS variables for theming, here's a concise fix:

The fix is complete! I've:

1. **Removed the inline style** from the ThemeSelector component
2. **Added a CSS class** `bg-theme-accent` that uses the existing `--theme-accent` CSS variable
3. **Applied the class** to the div element

This maintains the dynamic theming functionality while following best practices by moving styles to an external CSS file. The theme accent color will still update dynamically since the `--theme-accent` CSS variable is already being managed by your ThemeProvider.
