I'll add yellow and green colors to the gradient background in the HeroSection. Let me update the background gradient to include these colors for both light and dark modes.

Perfect! I've updated the background gradient to include yellow and green colors in both light and dark modes. The gradient now flows through a beautiful spectrum of colors:

**Light mode**: `from-green-50 via-blue-50 via-indigo-50 via-purple-50 via-pink-50 to-yellow-50`
**Dark mode**: `from-green-900 via-blue-900 via-purple-900 via-indigo-900 via-pink-900 to-yellow-900`

This creates a more vibrant and colorful background that transitions smoothly through green → blue → indigo → purple → pink → yellow, giving the hero section a more dynamic and magical Disney-like appearance in both light and dark themes.
