# Resolve import declaration conflict (2025-06-11 15:55:09)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Import declaration conflicts with local declaration of 'Navigation'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

The error occurs because you have both an imported `Navigation` icon from lucide-react and a local `Navigation` component function. You need to rename one of them to avoid the conflict.

The conflict is now resolved. I renamed the imported `Navigation` icon to `NavigationIcon` to avoid the naming conflict with your local `Navigation` component function. This allows both to coexist without any issues.
