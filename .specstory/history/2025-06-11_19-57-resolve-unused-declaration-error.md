# Resolve unused declaration error (2025-06-11 14:57:27)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'LiveDataItem' is declared but never used.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the code, the `LiveDataItem` interface is declared but never used in the file. Here are two concise ways to resolve this:

**Option 1: Remove the unused interface**

**Option 2: If you need to keep it for future use, prefix with underscore**

If you plan to use this interface later, you could have prefixed it with an underscore (`interface _LiveDataItem`) to indicate it's intentionally unused, but since I've already removed it, the error should now be resolved.

The interface has been removed since it wasn't being used anywhere in the code. If you need it for typing the live data response in the future, you can add it back when you actually implement that functionality.
