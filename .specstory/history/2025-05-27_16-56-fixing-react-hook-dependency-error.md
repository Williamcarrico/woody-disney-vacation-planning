# Fixing React Hook Dependency Error (2025-05-27 11:56:07)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'checkPendingChanges'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the error and the code, the issue is that `checkPendingChanges` is used inside the first `useEffect` but not included in its dependency array. Here's the fix:

The issue is that `checkPendingChanges` is defined after the first `useEffect`. Let me fix this by moving the `checkPendingChanges` function definition before the first `useEffect`:

Perfect! The fix is now complete. Here's what I did to resolve the "React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency" error:

1. **Moved the `checkPendingChanges` function definition** before the first `useEffect` that uses it
2. **Added `checkPendingChanges` to the dependency array** of the initialization `useEffect`

This ensures that:
- The function is defined before it's used
- The `useEffect` properly declares its dependency on `checkPendingChanges`
- The linting error is resolved

The `checkPendingChanges` function is wrapped in `useCallback` with an empty dependency array, so it won't cause unnecessary re-renders of the initialization effect.
