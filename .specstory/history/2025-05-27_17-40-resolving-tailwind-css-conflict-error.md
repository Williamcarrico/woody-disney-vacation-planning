# Resolving Tailwind CSS Conflict Error (2025-05-27 12:40:12)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'focus:ring-ring' applies the same CSS properties as 'focus:ring-2'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the linter error, the issue is that `focus:ring-2` and `focus:ring-ring` are conflicting. The `focus:ring-2` sets the ring width to 2px, while `focus:ring-ring` sets the ring color. These are different properties and should work together.

However, the linter is incorrectly flagging this as a conflict. The fix is to remove the redundant `focus:ring-2` since Tailwind's default ring width when using `focus:ring-ring` is already appropriate.

The fix removes `focus:ring-2` from the class string, keeping only `focus:ring-ring` and `focus:ring-offset-2`. The `focus:ring-ring` class applies the ring color using the CSS custom property `--ring`, and when used without an explicit width, Tailwind applies a default ring width. This resolves the linter conflict while maintaining the intended focus ring styling.
