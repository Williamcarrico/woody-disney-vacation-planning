# Fixing JSX Closing Tag Error (2025-05-24 23:29:44)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Expected corresponding JSX closing tag for 'div'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the linter errors and the code structure, there's a JSX tag mismatch. The issue is around line 816 where there's an extra closing `</motion.div>` tag.

Read file: src/app/dashboard/planning/page.tsx

---

Now let me check the structure around the problematic area to understand the nesting:

---

Read file: src/app/dashboard/planning/page.tsx

---

Let me check the end of the file to see if there are missing closing tags:

---

Read file: src/app/dashboard/planning/page.tsx

---

I can see the issue now. Looking at the structure, there's an extra closing `</motion.div>` tag on line 816. The problem is in the header section where there are nested motion.div elements, but one has an extra closing tag.

The fix removed too much. Let me check the structure more carefully and find the correct opening tag:

---

Read file: src/app/dashboard/planning/page.tsx

---

I need to restore the missing closing tag. The issue is that there should be a closing `</div>` for the main container div that starts at line 591. Let me fix this:

---

Perfect! The fix was simple - I needed to add the missing closing `</div>` tag for the container div that starts at line 607 (`<div className="container py-6 space-y-6 relative z-10">`). 

The error was caused by having an extra closing `</motion.div>` tag without a corresponding opening tag, which created a mismatch in the JSX structure. By adding the proper closing `</div>` tag for the container, the JSX structure is now properly balanced.
