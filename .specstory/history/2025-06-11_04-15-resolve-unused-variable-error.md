# Resolve unused variable error (2025-06-10 23:15:36)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'isValidCategory' is defined but never used. Allowed unused vars must match /^_/u.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the code, the `isValidCategory` function is defined but never used. You have two options to resolve this:

**Option 1: Remove the unused function** (recommended since it's not being used):

**Option 2: If you want to keep it for future use**, prefix it with underscore:

```typescript
function _isValidCategory(value: string): value is string {
    return value === 'all' || Object.values(RESORT_CATEGORIES).includes(value as typeof RESORT_CATEGORIES[keyof typeof RESORT_CATEGORIES])
}
```

I went with Option 1 since the function isn't being used anywhere in the code. The ESLint error should now be resolved.
