# Fixing undefined object error (2025-06-15 10:05:34)

How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Looking at the linter errors, the issue is that TypeScript can't guarantee that `tipsData[tipOfTheDay.category][tipOfTheDay.index]` is defined, even with the existing conditional check.

Here's a concise fix - extract the tip data to a variable with proper type checking:

I need to fix the syntax error - the closing parenthesis is missing for the immediately invoked function expression:

Let me use a simpler approach with optional chaining instead of the IIFE:

Perfect! The fix was simple - I added optional chaining (`?.`) to the property access:

- Changed `{tipsData[tipOfTheDay.category][tipOfTheDay.index].title}` to `{tipsData[tipOfTheDay.category]?.[tipOfTheDay.index]?.title}`
- Changed `{tipsData[tipOfTheDay.category][tipOfTheDay.index].description}` to `{tipsData[tipOfTheDay.category]?.[tipOfTheDay.index]?.description}`

This ensures TypeScript knows the objects are safely accessed even if they might be undefined, resolving the linter errors.
