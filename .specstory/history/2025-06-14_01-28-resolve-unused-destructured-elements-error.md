# Resolve unused destructured elements error (2025-06-13 20:28:36)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
All destructured elements are unused.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

Looking at line 23, you're destructuring `camera` and `scene` from `useThree()` but neither variable is used anywhere in the component.

---

The fix is to simply remove the unused destructuring assignment. The component doesn't need access to the camera or scene objects, so removing this line resolves the linting error.
