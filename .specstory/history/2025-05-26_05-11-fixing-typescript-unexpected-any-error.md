# Fixing TypeScript Unexpected Any Error (2025-05-26 00:11:39)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Unexpected any. Specify a different type.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Looking at the linter errors, you have several instances of `any` types that need to be replaced with proper TypeScript types. Let me fix these issues:

---

```diff
      XCircleIcon
  } from "lucide-react"
+ 
+ interface Attraction {
+     id: string
+     name: string
+     waitTime: number
+     type: 'RIDE' | 'SHOW' | 'MEET_AND_GREET'
+     tags: string[]
+ }
+ 
+ interface OptimizerFormData {
+     priorityAttractions: string[]
+     excludedAttractions: string[]
+     [key: string]: unknown
+ }
  
  interface AttractionPreferencesSectionProps {
-     form: UseFormReturn<any>
+     form: UseFormReturn<OptimizerFormData>
      parkId: string
  }
```

```diff
      const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState("")
      const [attractionFilter, setAttractionFilter] = useState("all")
-     const [parkAttractions, setParkAttractions] = useState<any[]>([])
+     const [parkAttractions, setParkAttractions] = useState<Attraction[]>([])
  
      // Set park attractions when parkId changes
```

I need to fix the type assertion for the SAMPLE_ATTRACTIONS data:

Now I need to fix the remaining implicit any parameter errors in the map functions:

Perfect! I've resolved all the TypeScript `any` type errors by:

1. **Created proper interfaces**:
   - `Attraction` interface for attraction objects with proper type constraints
   - `OptimizerFormData` interface for the form data structure

2. **Fixed the component props**: Changed `UseFormReturn<any>` to `UseFormReturn<OptimizerFormData>`

3. **Typed the state**: Changed `useState<any[]>` to `useState<Attraction[]>`

4. **Typed the sample data**: Added `Record<string, Attraction[]>` type annotation

5. **Fixed implicit any parameters**: Added explicit type annotations to map function parameters

The code now has proper TypeScript typing throughout, eliminating all the "Unexpected any" linter errors while maintaining type safety and better IDE support.
