# Fixing React Hook Dependency Error (2025-05-23 14:16:40)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'setDisneyTheme'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Looking at the error, the issue is that the `useEffect` hook for auto theme switching calls `setDisneyTheme` but doesn't include it in the dependency array.

The fix is to add `setDisneyTheme` to the dependency array:

The issue is that `setDisneyTheme` is referenced before it's declared. I need to move the auto theme switching `useEffect` to after the `setDisneyTheme` callback is defined.

Perfect! I've resolved the error by moving the auto theme switching `useEffect` to after the `setDisneyTheme` callback is defined and including it in the dependency array. This fixes both the missing dependency warning and the "used before declaration" linter errors.
