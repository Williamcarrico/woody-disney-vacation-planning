_**Assistant**_

I can see the issue here. The TypeScript error "Cannot find name 'div'" suggests that the JSX elements are not being recognized properly. This is a common issue that can occur when TypeScript configuration is not set up correctly for React/JSX. Let me check the TypeScript configuration and fix this issue.

---

Read file: tsconfig.json

---

Read file: src/types/jsx.d.ts

---

Read file: custom-next-env.d.ts

---

Based on the GitHub issue you referenced and the TypeScript configuration, this appears to be a common issue where TypeScript is not properly recognizing JSX elements. The issue is likely related to the JSX type definitions. Let me fix this by updating the component to ensure proper React imports and JSX recognition.

---



---

Now let me also fix the TypeScript assertions to use the `satisfies` operator instead of `as` to address the unsafe TypeScript assertion warnings:

---



---

I see the issue. The `satisfies` operator is being too strict about CSS custom properties. Let me revert to using `as React.CSSProperties` but with a proper type definition for CSS custom properties:

---



---

Let me check the current state of the file and fix the second TypeScript assertion as well:

---



---

Let me check if there's a React import issue by looking at the current file state:

---

Read file: src/components/magicui/warp-background.tsx

---

The issue appears to be a TypeScript configuration problem where JSX elements are not being recognized. Based on the GitHub issue you referenced, this is a common problem with Create React App TypeScript templates. Let me try a different approach by ensuring the JSX types are properly configured.

Let me check if there's a specific JSX configuration issue by looking at the package.json to understand the React version:

---

Read file: package.json
