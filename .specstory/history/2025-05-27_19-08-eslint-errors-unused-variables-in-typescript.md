_**Assistant**_

I can see you have two ESLint errors related to unused variables in your Firebase auth session server file. Let me help you fix these issues.

Read file: src/lib/firebase/auth-session-server.ts

I can see the two ESLint issues:

1. `NextRequest` is imported but never used (line 2)
2. `TOKEN_ROTATION_INTERVAL` is defined but never used (line 14)

Based on the [TypeScript ESLint documentation](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/no-unused-vars/), variables that are unused but intended to be kept should be prefixed with an underscore (`_`) to indicate they're intentionally unused.

Let me fix these issues:

Perfect! I've fixed both ESLint errors:

1. **Removed unused import**: I removed the `NextRequest` import from `next/server` since it's not being used anywhere in the file.

2. **Prefixed unused variable with underscore**: I renamed `TOKEN_ROTATION_INTERVAL` to `_TOKEN_ROTATION_INTERVAL`. This follows the TypeScript ESLint convention where variables prefixed with `_` are considered intentionally unused and won't trigger the `no-unused-vars` rule.

The `_TOKEN_ROTATION_INTERVAL` constant appears to be defined for future use in token rotation functionality, so prefixing it with an underscore is the appropriate solution rather than removing it entirely.

These changes will resolve the ESLint errors while maintaining the code's intended structure and future extensibility.
