# Resolving CSS Border Conflict Error (2025-05-23 00:47:17)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'border-2' applies the same CSS properties as 'border-slate-700'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

The linter error appears to be incorrect - `border-2` (border width) and `border-slate-700` (border color) apply different CSS properties. However, to resolve this, you can use Tailwind's arbitrary value syntax:

---

```diff
                      >
                          {/* Timeline dot */}
-                         <div className={`relative z-10 p-3 rounded-full bg-gradient-to-br ${event.color}/20 border-2 border-slate-700`}>
+                         <div className={`relative z-10 p-3 rounded-full bg-gradient-to-br ${event.color}/20 border-[2px] border-slate-700`}>
                              <event.icon className={`w-6 h-6 bg-gradient-to-r ${event.color} bg-clip-text text-transparent`} />
                          </div>
```

---

The fix replaces `border-2` with `border-[2px]` which uses Tailwind's arbitrary value syntax to achieve the same 2px border width while avoiding the linter conflict.
