# Fixing React Hook Dependency Error (2025-05-23 14:25:30)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'rotateToken'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Looking at your code, the `useEffect` at line 134 uses `rotateToken` but doesn't include it in the dependency array. The issue is that `rotateToken` is recreated on every render.

Here's the concise fix - wrap `rotateToken` in `useCallback`:

The fix is complete! I've:

1. **Wrapped `rotateToken` in `useCallback`** with an empty dependency array since it doesn't depend on any changing values
2. **Added `rotateToken` to the dependency array** of the `useEffect` that uses it

This resolves the missing dependency warning while preventing unnecessary re-renders of the effect.
