I'll enhance the floating orbs section with more sophisticated and colorful orbs using the colors you specified. Let me update the section with creative artistic elements:

Perfect! I've transformed the floating orbs section into a sophisticated and artistic display with all 7 colors you requested. Here's what I've added:

## Enhanced Floating Orbs Features:

### **üé® Color Palette & Themes:**
- **Red Orb** - "Passion & Adventure" - Deep crimson gradients
- **Blue Orb** - "Dreams & Magic" - Ocean-inspired blues  
- **Yellow Orb** - "Joy & Happiness" - Sunny golden tones
- **Green Orb** - "Nature & Growth" - Forest green gradients
- **Pink Orb** - "Love & Wonder" - Romantic pink hues
- **Orange Orb** - "Energy & Excitement" - Vibrant sunset colors
- **Purple Orb** - "Mystery & Magic" - Deep mystical purples

### **‚ú® Artistic Elements:**
1. **Radial Gradients** - Each orb has a 3-color radial gradient with strategically placed highlights
2. **Dynamic Box Shadows** - Glowing outer shadows and inner light reflections
3. **Varied Sizes** - From 20px to 32px for visual hierarchy
4. **Blur Effects** - Soft blur-sm for ethereal appearance
5. **Opacity Variations** - Different transparency levels (20-30%) for depth

### **üé≠ Animation Sophistication:**
- **Unique Motion Paths** - Each orb follows its own complex movement pattern
- **Multi-dimensional Animation** - X/Y movement, scaling, and rotation combined
- **Staggered Timing** - Different durations (16-24 seconds) and delays (0-6 seconds)
- **Organic Movement** - EaseInOut transitions for natural flow
- **Scale Variations** - Breathing effects from 0.7x to 1.4x scale

### **üé™ Creative Positioning:**
- Strategic placement across the entire hero section
- Mix of left/right/top/bottom positioning
- No overlapping while maintaining visual balance
- Responsive to different screen sizes

The orbs now create a dynamic, colorful, and magical atmosphere that perfectly complements the Disney theme while adding sophisticated visual interest to your hero section!

With sophistication and accuracy.

I'll implement the unused variables with sophistication and accuracy. Let me address both ESLint issues:

---

Read file: src/app/page.tsx

---

Read file: src/app/page.tsx

---

Now I can see both issues clearly. Let me implement them with sophistication:

1. **First, implement the `gradientStyles` in the HeroSection** - Apply it to enhance the dynamic background gradient
2. **Second, handle the unused error variable in the catch block** - Log it properly for debugging

Now let me also enhance the `gradientStyles` implementation by applying it to additional elements for a more sophisticated integration:

---



---

Perfect! I've successfully implemented both unused variables with sophistication and accuracy:

## üé® **`gradientStyles` Implementation**

### **Enhanced Dynamic Background**
- Applied live gradient styles to the hero background overlay with:
  - **135¬∞ diagonal gradient** using primary, secondary, and accent colors from live data
  - **Subtle blur effect** (0.5px) for ethereal appearance  
  - **60% opacity** to maintain readability while adding dynamism

### **Dynamic Title Styling**
- Enhanced the "WaltWise" title with live gradient colors:
  - **45¬∞ diagonal text gradient** synchronized with live data
  - **WebKit-compatible background clipping** for cross-browser support
  - **Subtle text shadow** for improved legibility
  - **Graceful fallback** to default styles when no live data available

## üêõ **Error Handling Enhancement**

### **WebGL Detection Error Logging**
- Renamed generic `e` to descriptive `error` parameter
- Added **sophisticated error logging**:
  - **Development-only logging** to avoid console pollution in production
  - **Contextual warning message** with emoji for easy identification
  - **Proper error object logging** for debugging WebGL detection issues

## ‚ú® **Sophisticated Features Added**

1. **Conditional Styling**: Both implementations use conditional rendering to gracefully handle undefined states
2. **Performance Optimization**: Only applies dynamic styles when live data is available
3. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Uses both `backgroundClip` and `WebkitBackgroundClip` for text gradients
4. **Development Experience**: Enhanced error logging only in development mode
5. **Visual Hierarchy**: Different gradient angles (135¬∞ vs 45¬∞) create visual distinction between background and text

The implementation now leverages live gradient data to create a truly dynamic and responsive hero section that adapts to real-time Disney park conditions while maintaining excellent fallback behavior!
