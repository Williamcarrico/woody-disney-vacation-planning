# Fix TypeScript type assignment error (2025-05-31 21:41:51)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Argument of type 'Recommendation' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Recommendation'.
  Types of property 'data' are incompatible.
    Type 'Attraction | DiningOption | ShowData | RestArea | MeetingPoint | PhotoData' is not assignable to type 'RecommendationData'.
      Type 'Attraction' is not assignable to type 'RecommendationData'.
        Index signature for type 'string' is missing in type 'Attraction'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

The issue is a type mismatch between the local `RecommendationData` interface and the actual data types returned by the recommendation engine. The simplest fix is to update the `RecommendationData` interface to match what's actually being returned.

---

This change makes the `RecommendationData` interface more flexible by using `any` instead of `unknown` for the index signature, which will allow the various data types (`Attraction`, `DiningOption`, etc.) returned by the recommendation engine to be compatible with this interface.
