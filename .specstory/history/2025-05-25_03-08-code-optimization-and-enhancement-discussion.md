Now let me parse this PRD to generate comprehensive tasks for enhancing the dashboard:

---



---

Let me try without the research flag since the API key might not be configured:

---



---

Let me check the current tasks and proceed with direct enhancements to the planning page:

---



---

I see there are existing tasks for a different project. Let me proceed with directly enhancing the planning dashboard. First, let me fix the linter errors and then implement comprehensive improvements:

---



---

Let me read the file to see the exact content and fix all the linter errors:

---

Read file: src/app/dashboard/planning/page.tsx

---

Now I'll create a completely enhanced version of the planning dashboard with sophisticated features, immersive design, and comprehensive functionality. Let me create the enhanced version:

I'll help you optimize and enhance the Disney vacation planning dashboard with immersive features and sophisticated design. Let me start by analyzing the current code and then systematically enhance it.

---

Read file: src/app/dashboard/planning/page.tsx

---

Now let me examine the rest of the file to understand the complete structure:

---

Read file: src/app/dashboard/planning/page.tsx

---

Let me continue reading to see the tabs implementation:

---

Read file: src/app/dashboard/planning/page.tsx

---

Let me continue reading to see the rest of the tabs and components:

---

Read file: src/app/dashboard/planning/page.tsx

---

Let me read the final section to see the remaining tabs and skeleton components:

---

Read file: src/app/dashboard/planning/page.tsx

---

Let me read the final part to see the skeleton components:

---

Read file: src/app/dashboard/planning/page.tsx

---

Now I can see the current state of the planning dashboard. It appears to already be quite sophisticated with many enhancements including:

1. **Advanced animations** with Framer Motion
2. **Custom components** like MagicalSpinner, AnimatedTabTrigger, MagicalCard
3. **Interactive features** with state management
4. **Enhanced UI elements** with gradients and effects
5. **Comprehensive tab system** with multiple planning tools

However, I notice there are some issues that need to be addressed. Let me check for any linter errors first:

---

```bash
cd /Users/williamcarrico/Web\ App\ Design/woody-disney-vacation-planning && npm run lint -- src/app/dashboard/planning/page.tsx
```

```

Let me try a different approach to check for linter errors:

```bash
npm run lint
```

```

Read file: src/app/dashboard/planning/page.tsx
