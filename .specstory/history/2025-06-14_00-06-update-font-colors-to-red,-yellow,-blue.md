I'll update the font colors in the Header component to use red, yellow, and blue instead of the current purple, pink, and blue gradient.

Perfect! I've updated the WaltWise logo text gradient to use red, yellow, and blue colors instead of the previous purple, pink, and blue. The gradient now flows from red-600 through yellow-500 to blue-600, creating a vibrant red-yellow-blue color scheme for the logo text.
