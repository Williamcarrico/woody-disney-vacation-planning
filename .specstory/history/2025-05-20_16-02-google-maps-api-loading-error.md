Okay, I can help you troubleshoot this "Google Maps JavaScript API could not load" error.

Often, the browser's JavaScript console will have more specific error messages from the Google Maps API that can pinpoint the exact problem.

Could you please open your browser's Developer Tools, go to the Console tab, and share any errors or warnings you see related to Google Maps? This information will be very helpful in diagnosing the issue. The error messages usually look something like:
`Google Maps API error: [ERROR_CODE] [Link to API document]`
or
`Google Maps API warning: [ERROR_CODE] [Link to API document]`

Based on the error code, we can then follow the troubleshooting steps outlined in the Google Maps Platform documentation, such as checking your API key, billing status, and API restrictions. [ref: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/error-messages]

Okay, the console errors confirm that the issue is due to your Content Security Policy (CSP) not allowing scripts from `https://maps.googleapis.com` and `https://www.googletagmanager.com`.

Your current `script-src` directive is: `'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com`.

We need to modify this to include the required Google domains. I'll update your `middleware.ts` file, as this is typically where CSP headers are managed in a Next.js application.

I will make the following changes:
1.  Add `https://maps.googleapis.com` and `https://www.googletagmanager.com` to the `script-src` directive.
2.  Based on Google's recommendations and common practice for Google Maps, I'll also check and update other relevant directives like `img-src`, `frame-src`, `connect-src`, and `style-src` to ensure all necessary Google Maps domains are included. This will help prevent other potential CSP issues with map tiles, styles, and other assets. [ref: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/content-security-policy, https://content-security-policy.com/examples/google-maps/]

First, I'll read the content of your `src/middleware.ts` file to see how the CSP is currently constructed.

---

Read file: src/middleware.ts

---

It seems your `middleware.ts` file doesn't explicitly define a Content Security Policy. In Next.js, if you don't define one in `next.config.js` or in the middleware, the browser might apply a default restrictive policy, or it might be inherited from somewhere else.

To fix the Google Maps issue, I will add the necessary CSP directives directly to your `middleware.ts`. This involves modifying the `response.headers.set` part to include the CSP.

Here's the plan:
1.  Define a comprehensive CSP string that includes the necessary Google domains for `script-src`, `img-src`, `frame-src`, `connect-src`, and `style-src` as per Google's documentation and best practices.
2.  In the `middleware` function, before returning the `response`, set the `Content-Security-Policy` header.

I'll now apply these changes to `src/middleware.ts`.

```

---

I've updated your `src/middleware.ts` to include a Content Security Policy.

Key changes:
- A `generateCsp` function has been added to create the CSP string and a nonce.
- The `script-src` directive now includes `https://maps.googleapis.com` and `https://www.googletagmanager.com`.
- Other directives (`style-src`, `img-src`, `font-src`, `frame-src`, `connect-src`, `worker-src`) have been populated with common and Google-recommended values to support Google Maps functionality.
- The CSP header is set on the `response` object.
- A nonce is generated and added to the `X-Nonce` header. You'll need to use this nonce in your `<Script>` tags (including the one that loads the Google Maps API) and potentially in a custom `_document.tsx` for any inline scripts or styles, to comply with strict CSP.

**Important Next Steps for you:**

1.  **Nonce Implementation:** You'll need to ensure the generated nonce is applied to your script tags. If you are using `next/script` for the Google Maps API, you can pass the nonce to it. For other scripts, you might need to access this nonce in your `_document.tsx` or page components and apply it.
    The `X-Nonce` header is set in the middleware, but making it available to your React components for use in `<script>` or `<link>` tags typically requires passing it down, perhaps through page props in `getServerSideProps` or by setting it in a React context if you read it on the client (though CSP nonces are primarily for server-rendered script/style tags).

2.  **Review `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'`:**
    *   `'unsafe-inline'` for `style-src`: This is often needed for third-party libraries that inject styles directly. If possible, try to remove it by ensuring all styles are loaded via `<link>` tags or by using libraries that support nonces for their styles.
    *   `'unsafe-eval'` for `script-src`: This is a security risk and is required by some libraries. Google Maps itself *should not* require `'unsafe-eval'` if properly configured with a nonce for strict CSP. However, other parts of your application or third-party scripts might. Investigate if you can remove it.

3.  **Test Thoroughly:** After these changes, please test your application thoroughly, especially the map functionalities and any pages that use Google Tag Manager, to ensure everything loads correctly and there are no new CSP violations in the console.

Let me know if you see any further issues or need help with the nonce implementation!

_**Assistant**_

Ah, it looks like there's a syntax error in the `generateCsp` function in `src/middleware.ts`. The way the template literal for the CSP string was formatted caused a parsing error. Specifically, the backslash `\` at the end of line 102 before the backtick `` ` `` is incorrect.

I'll fix this syntax error.

---



---

It seems the previous edit was not applied correctly by the model, which can happen sometimes. I'll try applying the fix for the syntax error in `src/middleware.ts` again.

The issue is the extraneous backslash before the backtick in the `csp` variable assignment.

---

```diff
      // worker-src blob: is for a known issue with Next.js and web workers in dev mode
      // style-src 'unsafe-inline' is often needed for third-party libraries, review if it can be removed
-     const csp = \`
+     const csp = `
          default-src 'self';
          script-src 'self' 'nonce-${nonce}' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://maps.googleapis.com https://www.googletagmanager.com https://cdn.jsdelivr.net https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com;
```

```diff
          frame-ancestors 'self';
          base-uri 'self';
-     \`.replace(/\\s{2,}/g, ' ').trim()
+     `.replace(/\\s{2,}/g, ' ').trim()
      return { csp, nonce }
  }
```

---

The syntax error in `src/middleware.ts` should now be resolved. I've removed the incorrect backslash from the template literal.

Please try running your application again. Remember the "Important Next Steps" I mentioned earlier, especially regarding nonce implementation and reviewing `unsafe-inline` / `unsafe-eval`, as those will be crucial for a secure and functional CSP setup.

Let me know how it goes!

I see the issue persists despite our changes. The error message suggests there's still a problem with the syntax in your `middleware.ts` file. Let's fix all the backtick-related issues in the CSP string template literals.

It looks like there might be issues with the backslash escaping in the regular expression at line 114 as well. I'll rewrite the entire `generateCsp` function to ensure it's properly formatted.

---

```diff
          frame-ancestors 'self';
          base-uri 'self';
-     `.replace(/\\s{2,}/g, ' ').trim()
+     `.replace(/\s{2,}/g, ' ').trim()
      return { csp, nonce }
  }
```

---

The edit didn't fix all the issues completely. Let's try a different approach by completely replacing the `generateCsp` function to ensure all syntax issues are fixed:

---



---

Perfect! I've completely rewritten the `generateCsp` function to avoid any syntax issues with template literals and backslashes. The new approach:

1. Creates an array of CSP directives
2. Joins them with semicolons instead of using a multi-line template literal
3. Avoids problematic escape sequences in regular expressions

Let's also make sure you can use the nonce value in your components. Based on the Next.js documentation for Content Security Policy ([ref](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/content-security-policy)), you'll need to read the nonce in your components like this:

```typescript
import { headers } from 'next/headers'
import Script from 'next/script'
 
export default async function Page() {
  const nonce = (await headers()).get('x-nonce')
 
  return (
    <Script
      src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js"
      strategy="afterInteractive"
      nonce={nonce}
    />
  )
}
```

This assumes you're using the App Router in Next.js. For the Google Maps API, you would use this nonce in a similar way.

Please try running your application again - the syntax errors should be resolved now. If you still face issues with Google Maps loading, please let me know the specific error message shown in the console.
