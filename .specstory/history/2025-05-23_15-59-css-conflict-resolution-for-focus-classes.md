# CSS Conflict Resolution for Focus Classes (2025-05-23 10:59:51)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'focus-visible:outline-ring' applies the same CSS properties as 'focus-visible:outline-1'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Looking at the error, you have conflicting outline properties in your Tailwind classes. The issue is that `focus-visible:outline-ring` is not a valid Tailwind utility and conflicts with `focus-visible:outline-1`.

Here's the fix:

```diff
        data-slot="tabs-trigger"
        className={cn(
-         "data-[state=active]:bg-background dark:data-[state=active]:text-foreground focus-visible:border-ring focus-visible:ring-ring/50 focus-visible:outline-ring dark:data-[state=active]:border-input dark:data-[state=active]:bg-input/30 text-foreground dark:text-muted-foreground inline-flex h-[calc(100%-1px)] flex-1 items-center justify-center gap-1.5 rounded-md border border-transparent px-2 py-1 text-sm font-medium whitespace-nowrap transition-[color,box-shadow] focus-visible:ring-[3px] focus-visible:outline-1 disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50 data-[state=active]:shadow-sm [&_svg]:pointer-events-none [&_svg]:shrink-0 [&_svg:not([class*='size-'])]:size-4",
+         "data-[state=active]:bg-background dark:data-[state=active]:text-foreground focus-visible:border-ring focus-visible:ring-ring/50 dark:data-[state=active]:border-input dark:data-[state=active]:bg-input/30 text-foreground dark:text-muted-foreground inline-flex h-[calc(100%-1px)] flex-1 items-center justify-center gap-1.5 rounded-md border border-transparent px-2 py-1 text-sm font-medium whitespace-nowrap transition-[color,box-shadow] focus-visible:ring-[3px] focus-visible:outline-1 disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50 data-[state=active]:shadow-sm [&_svg]:pointer-events-none [&_svg]:shrink-0 [&_svg:not([class*='size-'])]:size-4",
          className
        )}
```

The error is now resolved! I removed the invalid `focus-visible:outline-ring` class that was conflicting with `focus-visible:outline-1`. The `outline-ring` utility doesn't exist in Tailwind CSS, so removing it eliminates the conflict while preserving the intended focus styling with `focus-visible:outline-1`.
