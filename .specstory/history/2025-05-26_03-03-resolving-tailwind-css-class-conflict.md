# Resolving Tailwind CSS Class Conflict (2025-05-25 22:03:10)

_**User**_

```
'focus:ring-indigo-500' applies the same CSS properties as 'focus:ring-2'.

_**Assistant**_

The error occurs because `focus:ring-2` and `focus:ring-indigo-500` are conflicting Tailwind classes. The `focus:ring-2` sets the ring width, while `focus:ring-indigo-500` sets both the ring width (default) and color.

Here's the fix - remove the redundant `focus:ring-2`:

The fix removes the redundant `focus:ring-2` class since `focus:ring-indigo-500` already applies a ring with the default width (2px) and the indigo-500 color. This resolves the linter error about conflicting CSS properties.
