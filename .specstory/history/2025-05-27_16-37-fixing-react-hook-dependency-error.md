# Fixing React Hook Dependency Error (2025-05-27 11:37:17)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
React Hook useCallback has a missing dependency: 'shareCurrentLocation'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the error and the code, the issue is that `getCurrentLocation` uses `shareCurrentLocation` inside its callback but doesn't include it in the dependency array.

Here's the concise fix - move `shareCurrentLocation` above `getCurrentLocation` and add it to the dependency array:

I need to remove the duplicate `shareCurrentLocation` function that exists later in the file:

Perfect! The fix is now complete. Here's what I did:

1. **Moved `shareCurrentLocation` above `getCurrentLocation`** and wrapped it in `useCallback` with `shareLocation` as a dependency
2. **Added `shareCurrentLocation` to the dependency array** of `getCurrentLocation`
3. **Removed the duplicate function** that was defined later in the file

This resolves the ESLint error by ensuring all dependencies used within `getCurrentLocation` are properly declared in its dependency array, following React Hook best practices as outlined in the [Kinsta article](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/react-hook-useeffect-has-a-missing-dependency/).
