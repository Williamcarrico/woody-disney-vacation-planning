For the code present, we get this error:
```
Unexpected any. Specify a different type.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Read file: src/components/optimizer/recommendation-engine/types.ts

```diff
      AttractionItem,
      DiningItem,
+     ShowItem,
      PastVisit,
  } from "./types"
```

```diff
              if (currentContext?.timeOfDay) {
                  // Example: Boost fireworks at night
-                 if (item.type === "show" && (item as any).showType === "fireworks" && (currentContext.timeOfDay === "evening" || currentContext.timeOfDay === "night")) {
+                 if (item.type === "show" && (item as ShowItem).showType === "fireworks" && (currentContext.timeOfDay === "evening" || currentContext.timeOfDay === "night")) {
                      score += SCORING_WEIGHTS.CONTEXT_TIME_MATCH
                      reasoning.push("Perfect for this time of day!")
```

---

```diff
              // Simulate API call delay
              setTimeout(() => {
-                 let scoredItems = allItems
+                 const scoredItems = allItems
                      .map(item => scoreItem(item))
                      .filter(Boolean) as Recommendation[]
```

Fixed both linter errors by:
1. Adding the proper `ShowItem` type import and replacing `any` with `ShowItem` in the type assertion
2. Changing `let` to `const` for the `scoredItems` variable since it's never reassigned
