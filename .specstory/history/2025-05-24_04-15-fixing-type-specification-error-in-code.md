# Fixing Type Specification Error in Code (2025-05-23 23:15:31)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Unexpected any. Specify a different type.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_



---

Looking at the linter error, the issue is the use of `any[]` for the `animations` parameter. Since this is a framer-motion animation utility file, you should type it more specifically.

---



---

The fix replaces `any[]` with `Variants[]` since you're already importing `Variants` from framer-motion and this aligns with the other animation objects in your file. This provides proper type safety while resolving the linter error.
