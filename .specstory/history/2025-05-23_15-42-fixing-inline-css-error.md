# Fixing Inline CSS Error (2025-05-23 10:42:24)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
CSS inline styles should not be used, move styles to an external CSS file
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

The error is caused by the inline style `style={{ top: '24px' }}` on line 653. Here's the fix:

```diff
                                          {/* Timeline node */}
                                          <div
-                                             className={`absolute left-[15px] w-[16px] h-[16px] rounded-full z-10 border-2 ${item.status === 'closed' ? 'bg-white border-gray-400' : 'bg-white border-blue-500'
+                                             className={`absolute left-[15px] w-[16px] h-[16px] rounded-full z-10 border-2 top-6 ${item.status === 'closed' ? 'bg-white border-gray-400' : 'bg-white border-blue-500'
                                                  }`}
-                                             style={{ top: '24px' }}
                                          />
  
```

The fix replaces the inline style `style={{ top: '24px' }}` with the Tailwind utility class `top-6`, which provides the same `top: 24px` positioning. This resolves the linting error while maintaining the same visual appearance.
