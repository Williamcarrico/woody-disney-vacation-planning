# Fixing TypeScript Object Literal Error (2025-05-22 00:23:13)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'mass' does not exist in type 'Boolean'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

The error indicates that the `snap` prop on `PresentationControls` expects a boolean value, not an object with `mass` and `tension` properties. Change it to:

```tsx
snap={true}
```

Or if you need to keep the spring configuration, you could try:

```tsx
snapConfig={{ mass: 4, tension: 300 }}
```

depending on the actual API of `@react-three/drei`'s PresentationControls component.
