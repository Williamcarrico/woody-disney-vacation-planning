# Fixing unknown at rule error (2025-06-12 22:32:37)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Unknown at rule @theme
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

The `@theme inline` directive is a Tailwind CSS v4 feature. If you're using Tailwind v3 or your build tool doesn't support it, you can fix this by converting it to regular CSS custom properties.

---



---

The error should now be resolved. The `@theme inline` syntax has been replaced with a standard `:root` selector that works with all versions of Tailwind CSS.

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Unknown at rule @custom-variant
```

_**Assistant**_



---

The `@custom-variant` directive is also a Tailwind CSS v4 feature. Since you're likely using v3, you can simply remove this line as Tailwind's built-in dark mode handling will work without it.

---



---

The error should now be resolved. The `@custom-variant` line has been removed since Tailwind's built-in dark mode support will handle dark variants automatically.

---

_**User**_

No, I'm using v4 tailwind

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I need to revert the changes since you're using Tailwind v4. The issue is likely with your build configuration not recognizing v4 syntax.

---



---

The v4 syntax is correct. Check that:

1. Your `tailwind.config.js` is properly configured for v4
2. Your PostCSS config includes the Tailwind v4 plugin
3. Your build tool supports Tailwind v4's new directives

If using Next.js, ensure you're using a version that supports Tailwind v4, or consider using the Tailwind CLI directly for v4 features.
