# Resolve unused LiveDataResponse error (2025-06-11 14:56:26)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'LiveDataResponse' is declared but never used.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the code, the `LiveDataResponse` interface is declared but never used. Since the API endpoint doesn't actually return data in this format (it returns a generic response with `success` and `data` fields), you can simply remove the unused interface.

---

The unused `LiveDataResponse` interface has been removed, which resolves the TypeScript error. The code now only contains the interfaces that are actually used in the implementation.
