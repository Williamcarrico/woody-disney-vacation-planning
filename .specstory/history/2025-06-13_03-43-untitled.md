TypeError: target.closest is not a function
    at CustomCursor.useEffect.handleMouseEnter (http://localhost:3000/_next/static/chunks/src_237fd63d._.js:4103:32)

I can see you're getting a `TypeError` because `target.closest` is not a function. This typically happens when `target` is not a DOM element or is null/undefined. Let me examine the `CustomCursor` component to understand and fix the issue.

I found the issue! The problem is in the `handleMouseEnter` function on line 31. The issue occurs when `e.target` is not a DOM element or when it's null/undefined. Let me fix this by adding proper type checking and null safety:

The issue was that the `target` from the `MouseEvent` was not always a DOM element or could be `null`/`undefined`. This commonly happens when:

1. The event target is the `document` or `window` object
2. The event target is a text node or other non-element node
3. The event target is `null` in certain edge cases

The fix I implemented:

1. **Null/undefined check**: `!target` ensures the target exists
2. **Method existence check**: `typeof target.closest !== 'function'` ensures the target has the `closest` method
3. **Early return**: If either check fails, the function returns early without attempting to call `closest()`

This approach is safer because:
- It prevents the TypeError from occurring
- It follows the principle of defensive programming
- It handles edge cases gracefully without breaking the cursor functionality

The `closest()` method is available on all DOM Elements, but not on other objects like text nodes, the document object, or the window object. By adding these checks, we ensure the method is only called on valid DOM elements that support it.
