Your task is to remove the Stat Section from this code file.

I'll help you remove the Stats section from the Footer component. I can see there are two parts to remove:

1. The `stats` constant definition 
2. The JSX that renders the stats section

Let me remove these for you:

Now let me remove the JSX section that renders the stats:

Perfect! I've successfully removed the Stats section from the Footer component. Here's what was removed:

1. **Stats constant definition** - The array containing the stats data (Active Users, Recommendations, Photos Enhanced, Money Saved)
2. **Stats section JSX** - The entire `motion.div` block that rendered the statistics grid

The footer will now display without the statistics section, going directly from the header section to the navigation sections. The removal was clean and all the linter errors have been resolved since we removed both the data definition and its usage.

I'll help you remove the Trust Badge Section from the Footer component. I need to remove both the trust badges data definition and the JSX that renders it.

Now I need to remove the JSX section that renders the trust badges to fix the linter errors:

Perfect! I've successfully removed the Trust Badge Section from the Footer component. Here's what was removed:

1. **Trust badges data definition** - The `trustBadges` constant array that contained the trust badge objects with their icons, text, and descriptions (Secure, Trusted, Global, Award Winning)

2. **Trust badges JSX section** - The entire `motion.div` block that rendered the trust badges in a grid layout with animations

The footer will now display without the trust badges section, going directly from the social media section to the bottom section. All linter errors have been resolved since both the data definition and its usage have been removed.
