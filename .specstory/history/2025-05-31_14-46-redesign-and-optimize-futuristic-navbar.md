ConnectError: [unknown] No response from model

I see you're experiencing a connection error with Cursor. This appears to be the "No response from model" issue that several users have reported on the [Cursor community forum](https://forum.cursor.com/t/trouble-connecting-to-model/71873). Let me help you troubleshoot this and then we can continue with your FuturisticNavbar redesign.

## Troubleshooting the Connection Issue

Based on the forum discussions, here are some steps to resolve this:

### 1. **Check MCP Server Status**
The error might be related to your MCP servers. Try restarting Cursor or checking if the TaskMaster AI MCP server is responding properly.

### 2. **Try Different Models**
- Switch between different AI models (Claude, GPT-4, etc.)
- Sometimes the issue affects only specific providers

### 3. **Clear and Restart**
- Close Cursor completely
- Restart the application
- Try the request again

### 4. **Check API Keys**
Looking at your MCP configuration, ensure your API keys are valid:
```json
{
  "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "Ysk-ant-api03-...",
  "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY": "YOUR_PERPLEXITY_API_KEY_HERE"
}
```

### 5. **Temporary Provider Issues**
According to the [forum discussions](https://forum.cursor.com/t/were-having-trouble-connecting-to-the-model-provider/70808), these issues can be temporary and resolve within 30-90 minutes.

## Your FuturisticNavbar Analysis

While we wait for the connection to stabilize, I've already analyzed your current navbar component. It's quite impressive with:

### Current Features ✨
- **3D Animated Logo**: Disney castle with magical particles using Three.js
- **Enhanced Navigation**: Badges, trending indicators, premium features
- **AI Command Palette**: Voice recognition, categorized search
- **Real-time Notifications**: 4 notifications with different types
- **Complex Dropdowns**: Planning, Parks, Experiences sections
- **Theme Switching**: With magical particle effects
- **Mobile Responsive**: Hamburger menu with animations

### Potential Enhancements with Magic UI
Your navbar could be enhanced with these Magic UI components:
- **Border Beam**: Animated light borders around navigation items
- **Meteors**: Background meteor shower effect
- **Neon Gradient Card**: For dropdown menus
- **Sparkles Text**: For the app name
- **Interactive Grid Pattern**: As background overlay
- **Orbiting Circles**: Around the 3D logo

Once your Cursor connection is restored, I can provide a complete redesigned version incorporating these enhancements. Try the troubleshooting steps above, and let me know when you're able to connect again!
