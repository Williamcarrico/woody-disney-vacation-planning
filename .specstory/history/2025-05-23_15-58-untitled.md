For the code present, we get this error:
```
'border-current' applies the same CSS properties as 'border-2'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

The linter error is a false positive since `border-2` (border width) and `border-current` (border color) affect different CSS properties. However, to resolve the linter warning, you can be more explicit about which borders get which colors:

---

```diff
          <div
              className={cn(
-                 "inline-block animate-spin rounded-full border-2 border-solid border-current border-r-transparent",
+                 "inline-block animate-spin rounded-full border-2 border-solid border-t-current border-l-current border-b-current border-r-transparent",
                  sizeClasses[size],
                  className
```

---



---

This replaces the generic `border-current` with specific border color classes for each side (`border-t-current`, `border-l-current`, `border-b-current`), which should resolve the linter warning while maintaining the same visual spinner effect.
