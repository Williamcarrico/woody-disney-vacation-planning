Perfect! The fix is complete. I've:

1. Added `MotionValue` to the imports from `framer-motion`
2. Changed `progress: any` to `progress: MotionValue<number>` in the `WordProps` interface

This resolves the TypeScript error by properly typing the `progress` prop as a Framer Motion `MotionValue<number>`, which is the correct type returned by `useScroll().scrollYProgress` and expected by `useTransform()`.
