_**Assistant**_

I can see the issues in your `particles.tsx` file. The main problem is that TypeScript can't recognize JSX elements like `div` and `canvas`. This is a common issue when JSX configuration isn't properly set up. Let me fix these issues for you.

---

Read file: tsconfig.json

---

The TypeScript configuration looks correct. The issue is likely that the React types aren't being properly imported. Let me check if there are any missing React imports and fix the dependency issues as well.

---



---

Let me fix the React hooks dependency issues first, then address the JSX recognition problem:

---



---



---

Now let me fix the `onMouseMove` dependency issue by converting it to a `useCallback`:

---



---

Now let me check if there's a React types issue. Let me look at the package.json to see what React types are installed:

---

Read file: package.json

---

I can see that React types are installed (`@types/react` and `@types/react-dom`). The issue might be with the JSX configuration. Let me try a different approach by adding explicit React import for JSX:

---



---

Let me check if there's a custom Next.js environment file that might be affecting the types:

---

Read file: custom-next-env.d.ts

---

Let me check if there's a next-env.d.ts file:

---

Read file: next-env.d.ts

---

The issue might be that the TypeScript server needs to be restarted. However, let me try a different approach by explicitly adding JSX namespace declarations. Let me create a simple fix by ensuring the React JSX types are properly imported:

---



---

Now let me check if there are any type definition files that might be missing. Let me look at the src/types directory:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory src/types â€¢ **10** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| ðŸ“„ `images.d.ts` |
| ðŸ“„ `svg.d.ts` |
| ðŸ“„ `map-provider.ts` |
| ðŸ“„ `dining.ts` |
| ðŸ“„ `weather.ts` |

| ðŸ“„ `events.ts` |
| ðŸ“„ `resort.ts` |
| ðŸ“„ `disneysprings.ts` |
| ðŸ“„ `api.ts` |

</details>

Let me check if there's a global types file or if we need to add JSX types:
