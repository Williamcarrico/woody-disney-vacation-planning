# Fixing Unused Variable Error in Code (2025-05-25 21:52:55)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'epcotEntertainment' is declared but its value is never read.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Looking at the code, I can see that `epcotEntertainment` is defined but never used in the component. I also notice there are a few other linter errors. Let me fix these issues:

I've resolved the linter errors by:

1. **Removed unused variables**: Commented out the `epcotEntertainment` array and `Entertainment` interface since they weren't being used in the component
2. **Removed unused state**: Removed the `selectedFestival` and `setSelectedFestival` state variables that weren't being used
3. **Fixed apostrophe escaping**: Changed `'` to `&apos;` in the JSX text content

The entertainment data is preserved as comments so it can be easily uncommented and used when you add an entertainment tab to the component in the future.
