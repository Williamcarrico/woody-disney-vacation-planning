# Update global.css for header font (2025-06-13 19:04:59)

_**User**_


Implement this into the global.css file to support font in the Header. 

.cabin-sketch-regular {
  font-family: "Cabin Sketch", sans-serif;
  font-weight: 400;
  font-style: normal;
}

.cabin-sketch-bold {
  font-family: "Cabin Sketch", sans-serif;
  font-weight: 700;
  font-style: normal;
}

I'll add the Cabin Sketch font classes to your global.css file. Looking at the current file, I can see there's already a `.font-cabin-sketch` class defined, so I'll add these specific weight variants alongside it.

Perfect! I've added the Cabin Sketch font classes to your global.css file. The classes are now available for use in your Header component and throughout your application:

- `.cabin-sketch-regular` - for regular weight (400) Cabin Sketch text
- `.cabin-sketch-bold` - for bold weight (700) Cabin Sketch text

I can see in your Header component that you're already using `cabin-sketch-bold` on line 433 in the logo section, so this addition will ensure that class is properly defined and styled. The font classes are positioned right after the existing Disney-inspired font classes section for good organization.
