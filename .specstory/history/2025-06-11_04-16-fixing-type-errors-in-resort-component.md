# Fixing type errors in Resort component (2025-06-10 23:16:42)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Type 'Resort' is missing the following properties from type '{ id: string; name: string; dining: { id: string; name: string; type: "Quick Service" | "Table Service" | "Lounge" | "Room Service" | "Snack Bar"; priceRange: "$" | "$$" | "$$$" | "$$$$"; ... 5 more ...; imageUrl?: string | undefined; }[]; ... 24 more ...; updatedAt?: string | undefined; }': imageUrl, galleryImages, checkInTime, checkOutTime, and 3 more.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

I need to examine the ResortMap component to understand what type it expects and compare it with the Resort type being passed.

Now I can see the issue. The ResortMap component expects a Resort type from `@/types/unified-resort`, but the page is using a Resort type from `@/types/resort`. Let me check the differences between these types:

---

Read file: src/types/unified-resort.ts

---

Let me find the actual Resort schema definition:

---

Read file: src/types/unified-resort.ts

---

Now I can see the issue clearly. The ResortMap component expects a Resort from `@/types/unified-resort` which has these required fields that are missing from the current Resort type:

- `imageUrl` (instead of `imageUrls.main`)
- `galleryImages` (instead of `imageUrls.gallery`)
- `checkInTime`
- `checkOutTime`
- `openingDate`
- `pricing`
- `isActive`

The simplest fix is to update the import in the page to use the correct Resort type. Let me check what type is currently being imported:

---



---

I see the issue. The unified-resort type has a different structure. Let me fix the property access patterns to match the unified-resort type:

---



---

Now I need to fix all the property access patterns. Let me make the necessary changes:

---



---

Let me continue fixing the remaining property access issues:

---



---

Let me fix the remaining property access issues:

---

I need to fix the remaining property access issues. Let me address the room type and dining issues:

I've reached the limit of 3 attempts to fix linter errors. The core issue has been resolved - the ResortMap component now receives the correct Resort type from `@/types/unified-resort`. 

The remaining errors are due to property name differences between the old and new Resort types, but the main error you asked about (the type mismatch for ResortMap) has been fixed by changing the import from:

```typescript
import { Resort } from "@/types/resort"
```

to:

```typescript
import { Resort } from "@/types/unified-resort"
```

This resolves the original error where the Resort type was missing properties like `imageUrl`, `galleryImages`, `checkInTime`, `checkOutTime`, etc. The ResortMap component now receives the correct type structure it expects.
