Looking at your code, the `appDownloadLink` variable is declared but never used. Here are two concise solutions:

## Option 1: Use the link in the buttons (Recommended)

---

```diff
              </p>
              <div className="flex gap-2 mt-2">
-                 <Button variant="outline" size="sm">iOS App</Button>
-                 <Button variant="outline" size="sm">Android App</Button>
+                 <Button variant="outline" size="sm" asChild>
+                     <a href={appDownloadLink} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS App</a>
+                 </Button>
+                 <Button variant="outline" size="sm" asChild>
+                     <a href={appDownloadLink} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android App</a>
+                 </Button>
              </div>
          </div>
```

## Option 2: Remove the unused variable (Alternative)

If you don't want the buttons to be functional yet, simply remove line 10:

```tsx
// Remove this line:
const appDownloadLink = `https://disneyplanner.app/download?ref=${vacationId}`
```

**Recommendation:** Use Option 1 as it makes the buttons functional and provides better UX by utilizing the vacation-specific download link you're already generating.
