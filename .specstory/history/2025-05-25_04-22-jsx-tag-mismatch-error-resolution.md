_**Assistant**_

I can see the issue in your JSX code. There are mismatched closing tags around line 814. Let me examine the code structure and fix the JSX tag mismatch.

---

Read file: src/app/dashboard/planning/page.tsx

---

Now let me look at the specific area around the error to understand the structure better:

---

Read file: src/app/dashboard/planning/page.tsx

---

Let me look at the end of the file to see the complete structure and find where the missing closing tags should be:

---

Read file: src/app/dashboard/planning/page.tsx

---

Now I need to find the specific area where the JSX structure is broken. Let me search for the pattern around the error:

---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "motion\.div.*\n.*\)\n.*\}\n.*\)\n.*\}" â€¢ **0** files</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

---

Let me look at the specific area around line 814 more carefully:

---

Read file: src/app/dashboard/planning/page.tsx

---

I can see the structure now. The issue appears to be that the JSX structure is correct in the lines I can see. Let me check if there's a missing closing tag by looking at the structure more systematically. Based on the error message and the GitHub issue referenced in the search results, this looks like it could be related to a similar JSX parsing issue that was fixed in docz. Let me examine the structure around the container div:

---

Read file: src/app/dashboard/planning/page.tsx

---

Now I need to see the end of the main component to understand the complete structure. Let me check if there are missing closing tags at the end:

---

Read file: src/app/dashboard/planning/page.tsx

---

I can see the issue now! Looking at the structure, I can see that there's a missing closing tag for the main container div. The structure should be:

1. Main div (min-h-screen)
2. Background div (fixed inset-0)
3. Container div (container py-6)

But I can see that the main component ends with only one closing div, when it should have two more. Let me fix this:

---



---

I see the issue. I need to fix the indentation and structure properly. Let me correct this:

---



---

Let me read the exact content around the end to see the current state:

---

Read file: src/app/dashboard/planning/page.tsx

---

I can see the issue now. There's an extra space in the closing div tag on line 1432. Let me fix this:

---



---

I see the issue. The indentation is wrong. Let me fix this properly:

---



---

Let me read the current state again to see exactly what's there:

---

Read file: src/app/dashboard/planning/page.tsx

---

I can see the issue. There's a malformed closing div tag with a space. Let me fix this by replacing the entire problematic section:

---



---

I see the issue now. The problem is that I have the wrong indentation. Let me use the reapply tool to fix this properly:

---

```diff
              </motion.div>
              </div>
-         </div >
+         </div>
      )
  }
```

---

The reapply didn't fix the issue. Let me try a different approach and fix the entire end section properly:

---

```diff
              </motion.div>
          </div>
-         </div >
      )
  }
```

---

I've reached the limit of attempts to fix the linter errors. The issue appears to be with the JSX structure and closing tags. Based on the original error message about "Expected corresponding JSX closing tag for 'motion.div'" and the GitHub issue referenced in the search results about [docz JSX parsing issues](https://github.com/doczjs/docz/issues/1691), this seems to be a similar JSX parsing problem.

The core issue was that there were mismatched JSX closing tags in the component structure. The main component has a complex nested structure with:

1. A main `div` with `min-h-screen` class
2. A background `div` with `fixed inset-0` class  
3. A container `div` with `container py-6` class
4. Multiple `motion.div` elements for animations

The error was occurring because the closing tags weren't properly matched. While I attempted to fix the structure by adding the missing closing `div` tags, the indentation and exact formatting seems to be causing additional parsing issues.

To properly resolve this, you may need to:

1. Carefully review the entire JSX structure from the opening `return (` statement
2. Ensure each opening tag has a corresponding closing tag
3. Verify the proper nesting and indentation of all elements
4. Consider using a JSX formatter or linter to automatically fix the structure

The fundamental fix needed is to ensure the proper closing of the container div structure at the end of the component.

_**Assistant**_

I can see the JSX parsing error is still present. Based on the [GitHub issue about JSX closing tag detection](https://github.com/doczjs/docz/issues/1691), this type of error occurs when there are mismatched JSX tags. Let me examine the current structure and fix it properly.

---

Read file: src/app/dashboard/planning/page.tsx

---

Now let me check the end of the file to see the current closing structure:

---

Read file: src/app/dashboard/planning/page.tsx

---

I can see the issue now! Looking at the structure, I can see that the main component is missing the closing tags for the container div structure. The component should have:

1. Main div (`min-h-screen`)
2. Background div (`fixed inset-0`) 
3. Container div (`container py-6`)

But at the end, I only see one closing div. Let me fix this by adding the missing closing tags:

---



---

I see the issue is with the indentation. Let me fix this by replacing the entire end section with the correct structure:

---



---

Let me read the exact current state again:

---

Read file: src/app/dashboard/planning/page.tsx

---

I can see the issue! There's a malformed closing div tag with a space: `</div >`. Let me fix this:

---



---

I see there's still an issue with the structure. Let me fix this by replacing the entire problematic section with the correct closing structure:

---



---

Let me use the edit_file tool to fix this properly:

---

```diff
              </motion.div>
          </div>
-         </div >
      )
  }
```

I've reached the limit of attempts to fix the linter errors. The issue appears to be with the JSX structure and closing tags. Based on the [GitHub issue about JSX closing tag detection](https://github.com/doczjs/docz/issues/1691), this type of error occurs when there are mismatched JSX tags in the component structure.

The main issue is that the component has a complex nested structure with multiple `motion.div` and regular `div` elements, and the closing tags need to match exactly. The error suggests that there's a missing closing tag for a `motion.div` element around line 814, and the structure at the end of the file needs to properly close all opened elements.

To properly fix this, you would need to:

1. Ensure all `motion.div` elements have corresponding closing tags
2. Verify that the main container structure (the outer div with `min-h-screen`, the background div, and the container div) all have proper closing tags
3. Check that the indentation and nesting is correct throughout the component

The component structure should follow this pattern:
```jsx
<div className="min-h-screen...">
    <div className="fixed inset-0..."> {/* Background */}
        {/* Background animations */}
    </div>
    <div className="container...">
        {/* All content */}
    </div>
</div>
```

You may want to use a JSX formatter or carefully review the component structure to ensure all opening tags have corresponding closing tags.
