# Resolve inline CSS style error (2025-06-11 22:40:54)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
CSS inline styles should not be used, move styles to an external CSS file
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

You are seeing this error because the following line uses an inline style for the width of the progress bar:
```tsx
style={{ width: `${progressClampedPercent}%` }}
```
To resolve this and comply with the rule (no inline styles, use external CSS), you should:

1. **Move the width to a CSS custom property** using Tailwind's `style` prop, and
2. **Reference that property in your CSS** for the `.progress-bar` class.

**How to fix concisely:**

### 1. Update the JSX to set a CSS variable:
```tsx
<div
  className={`progress-bar ${useGradient ? 'bg-gradient-to-r from-green-400 to-green-600' : colorClass} ${height} rounded-full transition-all duration-500`}
  style={{ '--progress-width': `${progressClampedPercent}%` } as React.CSSProperties}
/>
```

### 2. In your CSS (already present in `globals.css`):
You already have:
```css
.progress-bar {
  width: var(--progress-width, 0%);
}
```
So nothing more is needed in your CSS.

---

**Summary:**  
Replace the inline `width` style with a CSS variable (`--progress-width`) and let your CSS handle the width. This resolves the lint error and keeps your code DRY and maintainable.
