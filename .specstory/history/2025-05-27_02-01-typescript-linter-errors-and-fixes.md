_**Assistant**_

I'll help you fix these linter errors in the restaurant utility file. Let me address each issue:

---

```diff
  export function getNextOpeningTime(restaurant: DisneyRestaurant): string | null {
      const now = new Date()
-     const daysOfWeek = ['Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday']
  
      for (let i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
```

---

Now let me fix the unsafe non-null assertions by replacing them with proper type guards:

Perfect! I've fixed all the linter errors in the restaurant utility file:

## Summary of Changes

1. **Removed unused variable**: Deleted the `daysOfWeek` array that was declared but never used in the `getNextOpeningTime` function.

2. **Replaced unsafe non-null assertions**: Changed all instances of the non-null assertion operator (`!`) to use the optional chaining operator (`?.`) instead:
   - `filters.cuisineTypes!` → `filters.cuisineTypes?.`
   - `filters.specialFeatures!` → `filters.specialFeatures?.`
   - `preferences.cuisineTypes!` → `preferences.cuisineTypes?.`

## Why These Changes Are Better

- **Type Safety**: Using optional chaining (`?.`) is safer than non-null assertions (`!`) because it gracefully handles cases where the value might be `null` or `undefined`, rather than asserting that it definitely exists.

- **Runtime Safety**: If any of these arrays are unexpectedly `undefined`, the code will now return `false` from the `includes()` method rather than throwing a runtime error.

- **Code Cleanliness**: Removing the unused variable eliminates unnecessary code and satisfies the linter's no-unused-vars rule.

The code now follows TypeScript best practices by avoiding unsafe assertions and properly handling potentially nullable values through optional chaining.
