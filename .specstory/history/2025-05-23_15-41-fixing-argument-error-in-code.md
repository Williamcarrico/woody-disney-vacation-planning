# Fixing Argument Error in Code (2025-05-23 10:41:24)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Expected 1 arguments, but got 2.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Looking at the linter errors, the `applyFilters` function from the `useRecommendationLogic` hook expects only 1 argument (the filters), but you're passing 2 arguments (filters and recommendations).

The fix is to remove the second argument from both `applyFilters` calls:

---

```diff
      const handleFiltersChange = (newFilters: RecommendationFiltersType) => {
          setActiveFilters(newFilters)
-         applyFilters(newFilters, recommendations) // Pass current recommendations to be filtered
+         applyFilters(newFilters)
      }
  
```

```diff
                      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Oops! Something went wrong.</h3>
                      <p>{error}</p>
-                     <Button onClick={() => applyFilters(activeFilters, recommendations)} variant="outline" className="mt-4 text-red-300 border-red-500 hover:bg-red-800/50 hover:text-red-200">
+                     <Button onClick={() => applyFilters(activeFilters)} variant="outline" className="mt-4 text-red-300 border-red-500 hover:bg-red-800/50 hover:text-red-200">
                          Try Reloading Suggestions
                      </Button>
```

```diff
                      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-slate-200">No Recommendations Found</h3>
                      <p className="max-w-md">
-                         We couldn't find any recommendations matching your current preferences and filters.
+                         We couldn&apos;t find any recommendations matching your current preferences and filters.
                          Try adjusting your filter settings or broadening your choices!
                      </p>
```

The fix removes the second argument (`recommendations`) from both `applyFilters` calls since the function signature only expects the filters. I also fixed the apostrophe escape issue in the error message text.
