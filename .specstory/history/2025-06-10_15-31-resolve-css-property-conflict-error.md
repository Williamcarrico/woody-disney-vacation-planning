# Resolve CSS property conflict error (2025-06-10 10:31:11)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'focus:ring-2' applies the same CSS properties as 'focus:ring-blue-500/50'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Looking at the error, `focus:ring-2` and `focus:ring-blue-500/50` are conflicting because they both apply ring properties. The ring color utility often includes a default width.

**Fix:** Remove `focus:ring-2` since `focus:ring-blue-500/50` already applies the ring styling:

The conflict is now resolved. The `focus:ring-blue-500/50` class provides both the ring color and default width, making `focus:ring-2` redundant.
