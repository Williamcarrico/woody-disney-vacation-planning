# Resolve unused variable error (2025-06-11 14:54:42)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'PARK_ID_MAP' is declared but its value is never read.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the code, the `PARK_ID_MAP` constant is declared but never used in the current implementation. The `fetchWaitTimesFromApi` function uses an internal API route (`/api/parks/${parkId}`) instead of directly calling the themeparks.wiki API where this mapping would be needed.

Here's a concise fix - simply remove the unused constant:

The error is now resolved. The `PARK_ID_MAP` constant was removed since it's not being used anywhere in the current implementation. If you need this mapping in the future for direct themeparks.wiki API calls, you can add it back when it's actually needed.
