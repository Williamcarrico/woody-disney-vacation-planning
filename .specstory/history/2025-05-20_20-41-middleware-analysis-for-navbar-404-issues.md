# Middleware Analysis for Navbar 404 Issues (2025-05-20 15:41:17)

_**User**_

Your task is to analyze the middleware file to see if there is anything in it causing the Navbar links/routes to route to a 404 page.

The middleware appears to be primarily focused on authentication and security rather than handling 404 errors specifically. Here's what I notice:

1. The middleware routes unauthenticated users to `/login` for any non-public path, even if that path doesn't exist. This could prevent proper 404 handling.

```typescript
// If user is not authenticated and tries to access protected route, redirect to login
return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', request.url))
```

2. The `PUBLIC_PATHS` array is very limited:
```typescript
const PUBLIC_PATHS = [
    '/',
    '/login',
    '/signup',
    '/forgot-password',
    '/api/auth/session'
]
```

3. There's no mechanism in the middleware to check if a route actually exists before applying authentication logic.

For non-existent routes, the middleware will:
- Allow access if it's in PUBLIC_PATHS (though you'll still get 404 if page doesn't exist)
- Redirect to login if user isn't authenticated and tries accessing a non-public path
- Allow access if user is authenticated (then Next.js would show its default 404)

To fix this, you could:

1. Update the middleware to explicitly handle non-existent routes by adding a custom 404 rewrite:

```typescript
// In middleware.ts, inside middleware function
// For handling non-existent routes:
if (/* logic to determine if route doesn't exist */) {
  return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL("/not-found", request.url));
}
```

2. Create an app/not-found.tsx file for the Next.js App Router to handle 404s properly.

3. Consider expanding PUBLIC_PATHS to include additional public routes that users should access without authentication.
