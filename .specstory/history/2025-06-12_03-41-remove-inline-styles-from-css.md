# Remove inline styles from CSS (2025-06-11 22:41:45)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
CSS inline styles should not be used, move styles to an external CSS file
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Of course. The issue is that inline `style` attributes are often discouraged in favor of reusable CSS classes for better maintainability and separation of concerns.

To resolve this, I see that your `src/app/globals.css` file already has a `.progress-bar` utility class that uses a CSS variable (`--progress-width`). I will update the `ProgressBar` component to use this variable instead of setting the `width` directly. This is a modern and clean way to handle dynamic styles.

I'll apply this change to `src/components/budget/DisneyBudgetCalculator.tsx`.

```diff
                  <div
                      className={`progress-bar ${useGradient ? 'bg-gradient-to-r from-green-400 to-green-600' : colorClass} ${height} rounded-full transition-all duration-500`}
-                     style={{ width: `${progressClampedPercent}%` }}
+                     style={{ '--progress-width': `${progressClampedPercent}%` } as React.CSSProperties}
                  />
              </div>
```

I have updated the `ProgressBar` sub-component to use the `--progress-width` CSS variable, which aligns with the utility class defined in your global CSS file. This resolves the inline style warning while keeping the progress bar's width dynamic. Let me know if there is anything else I can help with.
