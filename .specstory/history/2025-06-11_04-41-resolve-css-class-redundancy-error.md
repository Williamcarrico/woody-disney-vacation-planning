# Resolve CSS class redundancy error (2025-06-10 23:41:06)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'ring-2' applies the same CSS properties as 'ring-muted-foreground/50'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Looking at the error and the code, the issue is that you're applying both `ring-2` (which sets ring width) and `ring-muted-foreground/50` (which sets ring color and opacity) as separate classes, but the linter is flagging this as redundant.

The fix is to combine them into a single class that specifies both the width and color:

Let me try a more specific approach:

---

```diff
              className="absolute bottom-10 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2"
            >
-             <div className="w-6 h-10 rounded-full flex justify-center ring-2 ring-muted-foreground/50">
+             <div className="w-6 h-10 rounded-full flex justify-center border-2 border-muted-foreground/50">
                <div className="w-1 h-3 bg-muted-foreground rounded-full mt-2" />
              </div>
```

---

The issue persists with border classes too. Let me fix this by using a single class that combines both properties:

---

```diff
              className="absolute bottom-10 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2"
            >
-             <div className="w-6 h-10 rounded-full flex justify-center border-2 border-muted-foreground/50">
+             <div className="w-6 h-10 rounded-full flex justify-center outline outline-2 outline-muted-foreground/50">
                <div className="w-1 h-3 bg-muted-foreground rounded-full mt-2" />
              </div>
```

Based on the [Next.js discussion](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/78168) I found, this appears to be a PostCSS optimization issue where duplicate CSS properties are being removed during minification. The solution is to use a single class that defines both the width and color properties together.

Let me try using a box-shadow approach instead:

---

```diff
              className="absolute bottom-10 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2"
            >
-             <div className="w-6 h-10 rounded-full flex justify-center outline outline-2 outline-muted-foreground/50">
+             <div className="w-6 h-10 rounded-full flex justify-center" style={{ boxShadow: '0 0 0 2px hsl(var(--muted-foreground) / 0.5)' }}>
                <div className="w-1 h-3 bg-muted-foreground rounded-full mt-2" />
              </div>
```

---

Perfect! The linter error is now resolved. I've fixed the issue by replacing the conflicting Tailwind classes (`ring-2` and `ring-muted-foreground/50`) with an inline `boxShadow` style that achieves the same visual effect without triggering the CSS property duplication error.

The solution uses `boxShadow: '0 0 0 2px hsl(var(--muted-foreground) / 0.5)'` which creates a 2px border with the muted foreground color at 50% opacity, exactly matching the original design intent.

For the code present, we get this error:
```
CSS inline styles should not be used, move styles to an external CSS file
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Looking at the linter error, you need to move the inline style to a CSS class. Based on the [Next.js inlineCss documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/inlineCss), you can create a custom utility class in your CSS file.

---

```diff
    box-shadow: 0 0 0 4px var(--interactive-focus);
  }
+ 
+ /* Scroll indicator utility */
+ .scroll-indicator-ring {
+   box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px hsl(var(--muted-foreground) / 0.5);
+ }
  
  /* Reduced motion support */
```

---

Now update the component to use the new CSS class:

---

```diff
              className="absolute bottom-10 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2"
            >
-             <div className="w-6 h-10 rounded-full flex justify-center" style={{ boxShadow: '0 0 0 2px hsl(var(--muted-foreground) / 0.5)' }}>
+             <div className="w-6 h-10 rounded-full flex justify-center scroll-indicator-ring">
                <div className="w-1 h-3 bg-muted-foreground rounded-full mt-2" />
              </div>
```

---

Perfect! I've resolved the linter error by:

1. **Created a custom CSS class** `.scroll-indicator-ring` in `globals.css` that applies the same box-shadow effect
2. **Replaced the inline style** with the new CSS class in the component

This approach follows best practices by keeping styles in external CSS files while maintaining the exact same visual appearance. The solution uses CSS custom properties (`hsl(var(--muted-foreground) / 0.5)`) to ensure proper theme compatibility.
