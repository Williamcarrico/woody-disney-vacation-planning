# Fixing ConfettiButton onClick prop error (2025-06-11 13:06:41)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Type '{ children: Element; onClick: () => void; }' is not assignable to type 'IntrinsicAttributes & ConfettiButtonProps'.
  Property 'onClick' does not exist on type 'IntrinsicAttributes & ConfettiButtonProps'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the error, the `ConfettiButton` component doesn't accept an `onClick` prop directly. Let me check the Magic UI components to understand the correct usage.

I can see the issue with the `ConfettiButton` component usage. Let me examine the current code and fix the TypeScript error.

Read file: src/app/dashboard/messages/page.tsx

Now let me check the Magic UI components to understand the correct usage of `ConfettiButton`:

I can see that `ConfettiButton` is indeed a component from Magic UI, but looking at its implementation, it doesn't accept an `onClick` prop directly. Instead, it handles click events internally and triggers confetti effects. The component is designed to automatically trigger confetti when clicked, not to handle custom navigation logic.

Now let me fix the TypeScript error by replacing the `ConfettiButton` with a regular `Button` component that has the `onClick` handler:

Perfect! I've successfully fixed the TypeScript error by replacing the `ConfettiButton` component with a regular `Button` component that properly accepts the `onClick` prop. 

## Summary

The issue was that `ConfettiButton` from Magic UI is designed to automatically trigger confetti effects on click and doesn't accept custom `onClick` handlers. The component handles click events internally to create the confetti animation.

**The fix:**
- Replaced `ConfettiButton` with `Button` component
- Kept the `onClick={() => router.push('/dashboard/planning')}` handler for navigation
- Maintained the `ShimmerButton` wrapper for the visual effect

This solution:
1. ✅ Fixes the TypeScript error
2. ✅ Preserves the navigation functionality 
3. ✅ Keeps the shimmer button visual effect
4. ✅ Uses the correct component pattern

If you want confetti effects along with navigation, you could either:
- Use the `Confetti` component separately and trigger it programmatically
- Use the standalone `confetti` function from the canvas-confetti library
- Create a custom button that combines both functionalities

The current solution prioritizes the navigation functionality while maintaining the visual appeal of the shimmer button.
