# Fixing Unused Variable Error in Code (2025-05-22 21:00:48)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'isMoving' is declared but its value is never read.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Looking at your code, the `isMoving` state variable is being set but never actually used in the component. The most concise fix is to prefix it with an underscore to indicate it's intentionally unused:

---

```diff
    },
  }: SmoothCursorProps) {
-   const [isMoving, setIsMoving] = useState(false);
+   const [_isMoving, setIsMoving] = useState(false);
    const lastMousePos = useRef<Position>({ x: 0, y: 0 });
    const velocity = useRef<Position>({ x: 0, y: 0 });
```

---

I see the linter still complains even with the underscore prefix. Let me check if there's a better solution. Since `isMoving` is never actually used in the component, we can remove it entirely and just use a setter function without storing the state:

---

```diff
    },
  }: SmoothCursorProps) {
-   const [_isMoving, setIsMoving] = useState(false);
    const lastMousePos = useRef<Position>({ x: 0, y: 0 });
    const velocity = useRef<Position>({ x: 0, y: 0 });
```

```diff
  
          scale.set(0.95);
-         setIsMoving(true);
  
          const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
            scale.set(1);
-           setIsMoving(false);
          }, 150);
  
```

---

Now we need to remove the unused `useState` import:

---

```diff
  
  import { motion, useSpring } from "motion/react";
- import { FC, JSX, useEffect, useRef, useState } from "react";
+ import { FC, JSX, useEffect, useRef } from "react";
  
  interface Position {
```

---

Perfect! The linter error has been resolved. The fix involved:

1. Removing the unused `isMoving` state variable entirely
2. Removing the `setIsMoving` calls since they weren't affecting anything
3. Removing the `useState` import that was no longer needed

This is the most concise solution - if the state isn't being used anywhere in the component, it's best to remove it completely rather than keeping dead code.
