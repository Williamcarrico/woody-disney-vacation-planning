# Fixing Unused Variable Error in Code (2025-05-26 21:07:36)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'request' is declared but its value is never read.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the code, the `request` parameter in the POST function is declared but never used. Here are two concise ways to fix this:

**Option 1: Prefix with underscore (recommended)**

The underscore prefix didn't fully resolve the linter error. Let me try a different approach by removing the parameter entirely since it's not needed:

Now I need to remove the unused `NextRequest` import since it's no longer being used:

---

Perfect! The error has been resolved. Since the POST function doesn't actually use the `request` parameter (it just returns all wait times without processing any request data), removing the parameter entirely is the cleanest solution. This also required removing the unused `NextRequest` import.

The fix removes the unused parameter and import, making the code cleaner and eliminating the linter error.
