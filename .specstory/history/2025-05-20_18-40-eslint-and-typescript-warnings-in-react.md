I've fixed the ESLint errors in your Disney vacation planning app. The issues were:

1. Unescaped apostrophes in JSX text that needed to be replaced with `&apos;`
2. Unsafe TypeScript type assertions using the `as` keyword

For the apostrophe issues, I replaced:
- "couldn't" with "couldn&apos;t" 
- "They'll" with "They&apos;ll"

For the TypeScript type assertions, I:
- Added a helper function `isValidDifficulty` to properly type-check difficulty values
- Used proper type guards with `in` operator to check if keys exist in objects
- Added explicit type return annotations to functions
- Replaced multiple `as` assertions with safer type-checking approaches
- Used `as const` for literal types where appropriate

These changes maintain the functionality of your app while making it more type-safe according to ESLint rules.
