# Resolving React useEffect Dependency Error (2025-05-27 12:01:12)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'status.isLoading'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

The error occurs because `status.isLoading` is referenced inside the `useEffect` but not included in the dependency array. However, adding it would create an infinite loop since `setStatus` updates `status`.

The fix is to use a separate loading state variable instead of relying on the `status` state inside the effect:

The fix uses a local `isStillLoading` variable instead of referencing `status.isLoading` inside the effect. This eliminates the dependency issue while maintaining the same functionality - the timeout will only trigger if maps are still loading after 10 seconds.
