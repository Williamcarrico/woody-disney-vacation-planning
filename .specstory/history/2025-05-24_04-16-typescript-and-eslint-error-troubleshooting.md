I can see the linter errors in the `FuturisticNavbar.tsx` file. Let me fix these issues:

1. The `HolographicNavItem` component is trying to access a `label` property that doesn't exist on the `NavItem` interface (which has `name` instead)
2. The `count` parameter in `NotificationPanel` is unused

---



---

Now I need to update the reference to `label` to use `name` instead:

---



---

Now let me fix the unused `count` parameter in the NotificationPanel function by removing it since it's not being used:

---



---

I need to also remove the `count` prop from where the NotificationPanel is being used:

---

Perfect! I've successfully fixed both linter errors:

1. **Fixed the `label` property issue**: Changed the `HolographicNavItem` component to use the `name` property instead of `label` to match the `NavItem` interface definition.

2. **Fixed the unused `count` parameter**: Removed the unused `count` parameter from the `NotificationPanel` function signature and also removed it from where the component was being used.

The code should now compile without these TypeScript and ESLint errors. The navigation component maintains all its functionality while being properly typed according to the existing interfaces.
