# Fixing Unused Variable Error in Code (2025-05-23 11:04:25)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'date' is declared but its value is never read.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Looking at the linter error, the `date` variable is destructured but never used in the function. The most concise fix is to prefix it with an underscore to indicate it's intentionally unused:

---

```diff
      const {
          parkId,
-         date = new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 10),
+         _date = new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 10),
          currentTime = new Date().toISOString(),
          currentLocation,
```

---



---

Let me fix this by simply removing the unused `date` from the destructuring:

---

```diff
      const {
          parkId,
-         _date = new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 10),
          currentTime = new Date().toISOString(),
          currentLocation,
```

Perfect! This resolves the linter error by removing the unused `date` variable from the destructuring. The `date` property is still available as `params.date` if needed in the future for date-based filtering functionality.
