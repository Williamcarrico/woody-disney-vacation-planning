# Fixing Unused Variable Error in Code (2025-05-27 12:52:42)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'repeatDelay' is assigned a value but never used.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the code, the `repeatDelay` parameter is defined but never used in the animation. I can see two ways to fix this:

**Option 1: Remove the unused parameter** (simplest fix)

The linter error has been resolved! I removed the unused `repeatDelay` parameter from both the interface definition and the function parameters. This is the cleanest solution since the parameter wasn't being used anywhere in the animation logic.

If you later need to add a repeat delay functionality, you could implement it by adding `repeatDelay` to the motion transition object like this:
```typescript
transition={{
    duration,
    repeat: 1,
    delay: index * 0.1,
    repeatDelay, // Add this when needed
    repeatType: "reverse",
}}
```
