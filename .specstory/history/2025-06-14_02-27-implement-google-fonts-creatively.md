# Implement Google Fonts creatively (2025-06-13 21:27:45)

_**User**_

Your task is to implement these google fonts into the rest of this page.tsx file in a creative and artistic way. Leave the WaltWise font in Hero Section as is. 

.gloria-hallelujah-regular {
  font-family: "Gloria Hallelujah", cursive;
  font-weight: 400;
  font-style: normal;
}

.finger-paint-regular {
  font-family: "Finger Paint", sans-serif;
  font-weight: 400;
  font-style: normal;
}

.caveat-brush-regular {

Perfect! I've successfully implemented the Google fonts throughout the page in a creative and artistic way while maintaining the WaltWise font in the Hero Section as requested. Here's a summary of how I've applied each font:

## Font Implementation Summary:

### üé® **Finger Paint** (Bold & Fun):
- "Why Choose WaltWise?" section title
- "Navigate Disney World..." description text  
- "Fireworks" toggle label
- "WebGL Not Supported" error title
- "Loading magical fireworks..." loading text

### üñãÔ∏è **Gloria Hallelujah** (Playful & Cursive):
- "AI-Powered Planning" value prop title (slide 1)
- Value prop descriptions in carousel
- Fireworks instructions main text
- Various error and help messages
- "Preparing the show just for you" loading text

### üé≠ **Caveat Brush** (Handwritten Style):
- "Real-Time Wait Times" value prop title (slide 2) 
- "Explore the Magic" section title
- "Join thousands of families..." CTA description
- Fireworks keyboard instructions
- "Imagine beautiful fireworks here!" fallback text
- "Initializing fireworks engine..." loading text

### üèóÔ∏è **Architects Daughter** (Architectural/Sketchy):
- "Group Coordination" value prop title (slide 3)
- "Experience Disney magic..." tagline
- "Ready for Your Magical Adventure?" CTA title
- Various instruction and error texts
- Browser compatibility messages

## Creative Application Strategy:

1. **Thematic Matching**: Each font was chosen to match the personality of the content - playful fonts for fun interactions, architectural for technical content, etc.

2. **Dynamic Font Rotation**: The value props carousel dynamically changes fonts for each slide title, creating visual variety and engagement.

3. **Hierarchical Usage**: Different fonts for headings vs descriptions create visual hierarchy while maintaining whimsical Disney charm.

4. **Error & Loading States**: Even error messages and loading states use playful fonts to maintain the magical Disney atmosphere.

5. **Accessibility Maintained**: All fonts remain readable while adding personality to the interface.

The fonts now create a delightful, hand-crafted feel that perfectly complements the Disney magical theme while keeping the original WaltWise branding intact in the Hero Section! ‚ú®üè∞
