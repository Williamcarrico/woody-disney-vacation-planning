# Resolving React useCallback Dependency Warning (2025-05-27 12:11:46)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
React Hook useCallback has an unnecessary dependency: 'color'. Either exclude it or remove the dependency array.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the code, the `color` prop is used to calculate the `rgb` value, which is already included in the dependency array. Since `rgb` is derived from `color`, including both is redundant.

The fix removes `color` from the dependency array since `rgb` (which is derived from `color`) is already included. This eliminates the redundancy while maintaining the correct dependencies for the `useCallback` hook.
