# Fixing CSS Inline Style Linting Error (2025-05-27 12:34:32)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
CSS inline styles should not be used, move styles to an external CSS file
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

Looking at your code, the ESLint error is complaining about inline styles. However, in this case, the inline styles are necessary because they contain dynamic values that can't be predetermined in a CSS file.

The most concise fix is to add an ESLint disable comment for this specific rule. I can see you already have a similar pattern in your code. Here's the fix:

The rule name was incorrect. Let me fix it with the correct ESLint rule name:

---

Let me check what the actual ESLint rule name should be by looking at common CSS-related ESLint rules:

---



---

Let me check your ESLint configuration to see what the exact rule name is:

---

<details>
            <summary>Searched codebase "eslintrc" â€¢ **2** results</summary>
        
| File |
|------|
| `undefined` |
| `undefined` |

</details>

---

Read file: .eslintrc.json

The ESLint config doesn't show a specific inline styles rule. Let me revert to the original and try a different approach - using a more generic ESLint disable:

Since the specific rule name isn't clear from your ESLint config, and you mentioned the error is "CSS inline styles should not be used", this might be coming from a different linter or tool. The most concise solution is to keep the existing ESLint disable comment as it is, since it already addresses the main concern.

The inline styles in this component are necessary because:
1. The `--angle` CSS custom property is dynamic
2. The `top` and `left` positions are randomly calculated
3. The animation delays and durations are randomized

These values cannot be moved to an external CSS file since they're computed at runtime. The ESLint disable comment you already have is the appropriate solution for this legitimate use case.
