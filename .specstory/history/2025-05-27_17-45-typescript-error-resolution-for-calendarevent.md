# TypeScript Error Resolution for CalendarEvent (2025-05-27 12:45:23)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Argument of type '{ color: string | null; title: string; id: string; type: "note" | "park" | "dining" | "resort" | "travel" | "rest" | "event" | "fastpass" | "photo" | "shopping" | "entertainment"; startTime: string | null; ... 22 more ...; attachments: { ...; }[] | null; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'CalendarEvent'.
  Types of property 'startTime' are incompatible.
    Type 'string | null' is not assignable to type 'string | undefined'.
      Type 'null' is not assignable to type 'string | undefined'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

The error occurs because the database schema returns `null` values but the `CalendarEvent` type expects `undefined` for optional properties. The fix is to transform the event object to convert `null` values to `undefined`.

The issue is that I need to apply the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) to all the properties in the spread. Let me fix this:

I see the issue - I need to handle the boolean field as well and ensure all nullable fields are properly converted. Let me check the CalendarEvent type to understand what fields need transformation:

Now I can see the issue. Looking at the CalendarEvent type in `/src/types/calendar-events.ts`, I can see that `isHighlighted` is required (not optional) and should be `boolean`, but the database schema allows it to be `null`. Let me fix this:

The error is still persisting. Let me check what's happening on line 554 specifically. It seems like there might be another location where we're pushing the event. Let me look at the full context around that line:

---

Read file: src/lib/services/calendar-events-db.service.ts

---

I see the issue! There are actually TWO places where we're pushing events to arrays. I fixed the one in `getEventsByDateRange` but there's another one in the `getEventAnalytics` function around line 554. Let me find and fix that one too:

---

Read file: src/lib/services/calendar-events-db.service.ts

---

Found it! The issue is in the `getEventAnalytics` function around line 554. Let me fix that:

---



---

Perfect! The linter errors should now be resolved. The issue was that there were two places in the code where database events (which have `null` values) were being pushed into arrays typed as `CalendarEvent[]` (which expects `undefined` for optional properties). 

I've fixed both locations:
1. In the `getEventsByDateRange` function 
2. In the `getEventAnalytics` function

Both now properly transform the database event objects by converting `null` values to `undefined` using the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) to match the `CalendarEvent` type definition.
