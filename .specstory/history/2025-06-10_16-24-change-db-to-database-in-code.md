# Change db to database in code (2025-06-10 11:24:46)

_**User**_

Use database in place of db.

_**Assistant**_

I'll fix the import error by changing `db` to `database` in the import statement and usage.

Let me check the Firebase config file to see what's actually exported:

---

Read file: src/lib/firebase/config.ts

Let me check the actual Firebase configuration file:

---

Read file: src/lib/firebase/firebase.config.ts

Now I can see that `database` is exported from the firebase.config.ts file, but the config.ts file only re-exports `auth`. I need to update the config.ts file to also export `database` (which is the Realtime Database), and then update the hook to use `database` instead of `db`. However, looking at the hook, it's using Firestore operations (`doc`, `onSnapshot` from 'firebase/firestore'), so it should actually be using `firestore`, not `database`.

Let me check what the hook is actually trying to do - it's using Firestore operations, so it should import `firestore`:

Now I need to update the usage of `db` to `firestore` in the hook:

Perfect! I've successfully fixed the import error by:

1. **Changed the import** from `db` to `firestore` and imported it directly from the Firebase config file
2. **Updated the usage** in the hook from `db` to `firestore`

The hook is now correctly using Firestore (which is the document database) rather than the Realtime Database. This makes sense since the code is using Firestore operations like `doc()` and `onSnapshot()` for document-based data storage, which aligns with the memory that states all data storage should use Firebase Firestore and Realtime Database.
