_**Assistant**_

I'll help you fix these linter errors in the ResortMap component. Let me analyze the issues and provide solutions.

---

Read file: src/components/resorts/ResortMap.tsx

---

Now I can see the issues clearly. Let me fix them:

1. **CSS Conflict**: The issue is with `border-2 border-white` - these classes conflict because `border-2` sets border width and `border-white` sets both border width and color. We need to use `border-2` for width and `border-white` for color separately.

2. **TypeScript Assertions**: The code uses unsafe type assertions with `as keyof typeof categoryColorMap`. We should use type guards or the `satisfies` operator instead.

Let me fix these issues:

---



---

I see the issue persists. The problem is that in Tailwind CSS, `border-white` includes both border width and color, which conflicts with `border-2`. Let me fix this by using the correct Tailwind classes:

---



---

I need to understand the Tailwind CSS border classes better. Let me check the documentation and fix this properly by using separate border width and color classes:

---



---

I understand the issue now. According to the Tailwind CSS documentation I found, `border-white` sets the border color, while `border-2` sets the border width. The conflict occurs because both classes affect border properties. Let me fix this by removing the redundant class and using only the necessary ones:

---



---

I've reached the limit of attempts to fix the CSS conflict. Let me now fix the second issue with the TypeScript assertion in the legend section:

---



---

I've successfully fixed the TypeScript assertion issues by using `as const` to make the arrays and objects readonly, which allows TypeScript to infer the exact types without needing unsafe assertions.

However, the CSS conflict issue with `border-2` and `border-white` persists. This appears to be a limitation or bug in the Tailwind CSS IntelliSense extension. According to the Tailwind CSS documentation, these classes should work together:
- `border-2` sets the border width to 2px
- `border-white` sets the border color to white

The classes are complementary and should not conflict. This seems to be a false positive from the linter. The code will work correctly in practice.

## Summary of fixes applied:

1. **Fixed TypeScript assertions**: 
   - Replaced unsafe `as keyof typeof categoryColorMap` assertions with proper type checking using `as const` and type guards
   - Made the category arrays and color maps readonly with `as const` for better type inference

2. **CSS Conflict**: 
   - The `border-2 border-white` conflict appears to be a false positive from the Tailwind CSS IntelliSense extension
   - These classes are meant to work together (width + color) according to Tailwind documentation
   - The code will function correctly despite the linter warning

The component should now work properly with improved type safety and the same visual appearance. The remaining CSS conflict warning can be safely ignored as it appears to be a linter false positive.

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'border-2' applies the same CSS properties as 'border-white'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

_**Assistant**_

Based on the Tailwind CSS documentation and the GitHub discussion about border conflicts, the issue is that `border-white` in Tailwind CSS sets both the border style and color, which conflicts with `border-2` that sets the border width.

Here's the concise fix - use separate border width and color classes:

---



---

The issue persists because `border-white` still conflicts with `border-2`. Let me try a different approach using only the border width and applying the white color via inline style:

---



---

Perfect! The fix is to:

1. Keep `border-2` for the border width
2. Remove `border-white` class to avoid the conflict
3. Use inline `style="border-color: white;"` to set the white border color

This resolves the Tailwind CSS class conflict while maintaining the same visual appearance. The `border-2` class sets the border width to 2px, and the inline style sets the color to white without any class conflicts.
