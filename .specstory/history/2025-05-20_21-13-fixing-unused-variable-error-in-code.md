# Fixing Unused Variable Error in Code (2025-05-20 16:13:30)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'user' is declared but its value is never read.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

```diff
          // Revoke refresh tokens to force new token generation
          await auth.revokeRefreshTokens(uid)
- 
-         // Get new token from user
-         const user = await auth.getUser(uid)
  
          // Create new custom token
```

Removed the unused `user` variable and its corresponding comment as it wasn't being used anywhere in the function.
