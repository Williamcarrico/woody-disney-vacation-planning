# Fixing Module Import Error in Code (2025-05-22 20:17:29)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Cannot find module '@/components/ui/drawer' or its corresponding type declarations.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

The error occurs because the Drawer component from shadcn/ui hasn't been installed in your project yet. You need to add it using the shadcn CLI:

---

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add drawer
```

```
✔ Checking registry.
  Installing dependencies.

It looks like you are using React 19. 
Some packages may fail to install due to peer dependency issues in npm (see http
s://ui.shadcn.com/react-19).

✔ How would you like to proceed? › Use --legacy-peer-deps
✔ Installing dependencies.
✔ Created 1 file:
  - src/components/ui/drawer.tsx


```

---

Perfect! The Drawer component has been successfully installed. The shadcn CLI has created the `drawer.tsx` file in your `src/components/ui/` directory. 

The error should now be resolved. The import statement `import { Drawer, DrawerContent, DrawerDescription, DrawerHeader, DrawerTitle } from '@/components/ui/drawer'` will now work correctly since the component file exists at the expected location.
