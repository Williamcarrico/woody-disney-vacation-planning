# Fixing React Hook Dependency Error (2025-05-21 12:43:35)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'fetchWaitTimes'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

```diff
  
          return () => clearInterval(interval);
-     }, [parkId]);
+     }, [parkId, fetchWaitTimes]);
  
      // Merge attraction data with wait times
```

The quick fix is to add `fetchWaitTimes` to your dependency array. This tells React that the effect depends on this function and should re-run when it changes.

For a more robust solution, you could use `useCallback` to memoize the `fetchWaitTimes` function:

```typescript
const fetchWaitTimes = useCallback(async () => {
  setIsLoading(true);
  try {
    const data = await getAttractionWaitTimes(parkId);
    // Rest of your function...
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching wait times:', error);
  } finally {
    setIsLoading(false);
  }
}, [parkId]);
```

This would prevent the function from being recreated on every render.
