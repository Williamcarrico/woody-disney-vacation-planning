# Fixing TypeScript Unexpected Any Error (2025-05-26 14:02:36)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Unexpected any. Specify a different type.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Looking at the code, the issue is that `updateData` is typed as `any`, which TypeScript's linter flags as unsafe. I need to examine the geofences schema to create a proper type for the update data.

Now I can see the geofences schema. Let me create a proper type for the update data based on the schema fields that can be updated:

Perfect! I've fixed the TypeScript error by replacing the `any` type with a proper type. Here's what I did:

**Solution**: Changed `const updateData: any = {` to `const updateData: Partial<typeof geofences.$inferInsert> = {`

**Explanation**: 
- `typeof geofences.$inferInsert` gives us the exact type for inserting/updating geofence records based on the Drizzle schema
- `Partial<>` makes all properties optional, which is perfect for update operations where you only want to update specific fields
- This provides full type safety while allowing the flexible update pattern used in the code

The fix is concise and leverages Drizzle's built-in type inference to ensure type safety without having to manually define all the possible update fields.
