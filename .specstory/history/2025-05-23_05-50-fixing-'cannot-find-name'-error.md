# Fixing 'Cannot find name' Error (2025-05-23 00:50:12)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Cannot find name 'div'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

The error "Cannot find name 'div'" typically occurs when React isn't imported in a JSX file. Add the React import at the top of the file:

---

```diff
  "use client"
  
+ import React from "react"
  import { useState } from "react"
  import { attractions } from "@/lib/utils/attractionData"
```

---

This adds the missing React import which should resolve the TypeScript error about not being able to find the name 'div'. The error occurs because TypeScript needs to know what JSX elements like `<div>` are, and this is provided by the React import.
