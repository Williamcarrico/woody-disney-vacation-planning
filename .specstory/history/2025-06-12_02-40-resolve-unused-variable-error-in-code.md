# Resolve unused variable error in code (2025-06-11 21:40:40)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'CTASection' is defined but never used. Allowed unused vars must match /^_/u.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

The error occurs because `CTASection` is defined but not used in the `LandingPage` component. Looking at the code, I can see that `CTASection` is missing from the main component's JSX.

The fix is simple: add `<CTASection />` to the JSX in the `LandingPage` component. The `CTASection` component was defined but never rendered, which caused the ESLint error.
