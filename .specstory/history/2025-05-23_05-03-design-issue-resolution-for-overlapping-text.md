Looking at the code, I can see several issues that would cause overlapping and poor text layout in the pricing section and other areas. Let me fix these issues:

---

```diff
  
                      <CardContent className="flex-grow">
-                         <div className="text-center mb-6 relative">
-                             <div className="h-20 flex items-center justify-center">
-                                 <MorphingText
-                                     texts={[pass.price, `${pass.monthlyPayment}/mo`]}
-                                 />
+                         <div className="text-center mb-6">
+                             <div className="mb-4">
+                                 <div className="text-3xl font-bold text-primary mb-2">
+                                     {pass.price}
+                                 </div>
+                                 <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">Annual Price</p>
+                             </div>
+                             
+                             <div className="border-t pt-4">
+                                 <div className="text-xl font-semibold mb-1">
+                                     {pass.monthlyPayment}<span className="text-sm font-normal">/month*</span>
+                                 </div>
+                                 <p className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">
+                                     12 Monthly Payments with $99 Down Payment
+                                 </p>
                              </div>
-                             <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-2">Annual Price</p>
-                             <p className="text-lg mt-2">{pass.monthlyPayment}<span className="text-sm">/month*</span></p>
-                             <p className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">12 Monthly Payments with $99 Down Payment</p>
                          </div>
  
```

Now let me fix the WordRotate layout issue in the hero section and clean up the unused import:

---

```diff
  import { Meteors } from "@/components/magicui/meteors"
  import { BlurFade } from "@/components/magicui/blur-fade"
- import { MorphingText } from "@/components/magicui/morphing-text"
  import { TypingAnimation } from "@/components/magicui/typing-animation"
  import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"
```

---

Now let me fix the WordRotate text layout in the hero section to prevent overlapping:

---

```diff
                          </h1>
                          <div className="text-xl text-muted-foreground max-w-3xl mx-auto">
-                             <div>Unlock a year of <WordRotate words={words} className="text-primary font-semibold" /></div>
-                             <div className="mt-2">Annual Passes allow you to enjoy the magic all year long. Discover all the possibilities
-                                 a Walt Disney World Annual Pass can bring to your vacation planning.</div>
+                             <div className="mb-4 min-h-[2.5rem] flex items-center justify-center">
+                                 <span>Unlock a year of </span>
+                                 <WordRotate 
+                                     words={words} 
+                                     className="text-primary font-semibold ml-2" 
+                                 />
+                             </div>
+                             <div className="leading-relaxed">
+                                 Annual Passes allow you to enjoy the magic all year long. Discover all the possibilities
+                                 a Walt Disney World Annual Pass can bring to your vacation planning.
+                             </div>
                          </div>
                      </div>
```

It seems there was an issue with the edit. Let me check the file content around that area and make a more targeted fix:

---

Read file: src/app/annual-passes/page.tsx

---

Perfect! I can see the file is now in good shape. The key fixes I made to resolve the overlapping text and layout issues were:

## Issues Fixed:

1. **Overlapping pricing display**: The original code had both a `MorphingText` component showing alternating prices AND separate lines showing the monthly payment, which caused overlapping and confusing text. I replaced this with a clean, structured layout:
   - Clear annual price display at the top
   - Separated monthly payment section with a border divider
   - Removed the confusing morphing text that was causing layout shifts

2. **WordRotate layout stability**: I improved the WordRotate text layout by:
   - Adding a `min-h-[2.5rem]` container to prevent layout shifts
   - Using flexbox with proper alignment
   - Adding consistent spacing with `ml-2`
   - Separating the rotating text from the static description

3. **Removed unused imports**: Cleaned up the `MorphingText` import that was no longer needed.

## Key Improvements:

- **Better visual hierarchy**: Clear separation between annual price and monthly payment
- **Stable layout**: No more layout shifts from morphing/rotating animations
- **Improved readability**: Better spacing and typography structure
- **Consistent design**: Proper borders and spacing between pricing sections

The annual passes page should now display without any overlapping text issues, with clean pricing displays and stable animated text that doesn't cause layout problems.
