# TypeScript Type Error Resolution (2025-05-23 10:26:50)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Type 'ViewMode' is not assignable to type '"grid" | "list" | "featured" | undefined'.
  Type '"map"' is not assignable to type '"grid" | "list" | "featured" | undefined'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

Looking at the error, the issue is that `ViewMode` includes "map" but `RestaurantCard`'s `variant` prop only accepts "grid", "list", "featured", or undefined.

Since there's no "map" tab in your UI (only grid and list tabs are rendered), the simplest fix is to remove "map" from the `ViewMode` type:

---

```diff
  import { useState, useMemo, useCallback, useEffect } from "react"
  import { motion, AnimatePresence } from "framer-motion"
- import { Grid3x3, List, Heart, TrendingUp } from "lucide-react"
+ import { Grid3x3, List, Heart, TrendingUp, Utensils } from "lucide-react"
  
  import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
```

```diff
  
  type SortOption = "name" | "rating" | "price-low" | "price-high" | "popular" | "newest"
- type ViewMode = "grid" | "list" | "map"
+ type ViewMode = "grid" | "list"
  
  const sortOptions = [
```

This fixes both errors:

1. **Removes "map" from `ViewMode`** - Since there's no map tab in your UI and `RestaurantCard` doesn't support a "map" variant, removing it aligns the type with what's actually implemented.

2. **Imports `Utensils`** - Adds the missing icon import from lucide-react.

The `viewMode` can now only be "grid" or "list", which matches both your UI tabs and the `RestaurantCard` component's expected variants.
