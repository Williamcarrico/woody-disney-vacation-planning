# AI-Powered Itinerary Planning System

This module implements advanced AI capabilities for the Disney vacation planning application, providing a more personalized and adaptive planning experience. The system consists of three main components:

## 1. Natural Language Processing for Planning (`PlannerChat`)

This component provides a conversational interface for itinerary planning, allowing users to describe their ideal Disney day in natural language. The system:

- Analyzes user input to extract preferences, party composition, and priorities
- Generates tailored itineraries based on user descriptions
- Provides conversational responses explaining the generated plan
- Allows users to refine their plans through continued dialogue
- Supports feedback collection to improve future recommendations

## 2. Machine Learning-Based Recommendations (`PreferenceLearner`)

This component tracks user preferences and past behavior to provide personalized recommendations:

- Analyzes past attractions, shows, and experiences the user has enjoyed
- Identifies patterns in user preferences (e.g., preference for thrill rides or character experiences)
- Suggests attractions with high likelihood of user enjoyment
- Provides explainable recommendations with confidence scores
- Displays the user's learned preferences for transparency

## 3. Adaptive Itineraries (`AdaptiveItinerary`)

This component creates itineraries that adapt to changing conditions in real-time:

- Monitors wait times, weather forecasts, attraction closures, and crowd levels
- Generates notifications when significant changes affect the plan
- Provides alternative recommendations when needed
- Allows users to apply suggested changes with a single click
- Maintains a history of changes and updates for reference

## Integration

These components integrate with the existing itinerary optimizer to enhance the overall planning experience:

- The NLP component feeds into the optimizer with extracted parameters
- The ML recommender influences attraction prioritization
- The adaptive system provides real-time adjustments to existing plans

## Future Enhancements

Planned future improvements include:

- Integration with real-time Disney park API data
- Advanced ML models trained on larger datasets of user behavior
- Multi-day planning with sophisticated cross-day optimization
- Integration with mobile notifications for on-the-go updates
- Weather forecast integration for better predictive adjustments
