# ParkMap Component - Interactive Map Implementation

## Overview

The ParkMap component has been completely reimplemented using **Leaflet** - a leading open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. This replaces the previous placeholder implementation with a fully functional, sophisticated mapping solution.

## Key Features Implemented

### 🗺️ **Interactive Leaflet Map**
- **Real map tiles** from OpenStreetMap with smooth pan/zoom
- **Mobile-friendly** touch gestures and responsive design
- **Lightweight** at only ~42KB (Leaflet core)
- **High performance** with hardware acceleration

### 📍 **Smart Attraction Markers**
- **Dynamic marker sizing** based on attraction type (rides vs shows)
- **Color-coded status indicators**:
  - 🟢 Green (0-10 min wait)
  - 🔵 Blue (11-30 min wait)
  - 🟠 Orange (31-60 min wait)
  - 🔴 Red (60+ min wait)
  - ⚠️ Amber (attraction down)
  - ⚫ Gray (closed)
- **Wait time display** directly on markers in wait times mode
- **Status icons** for non-operating attractions
- **Interactive popups** with detailed attraction information

### 🎯 **Geolocation & User Location**
- **GPS location tracking** with accuracy indicator
- **Animated user location marker** with pulsing effect
- **Error handling** for location permission/availability issues
- **Privacy-aware** location requests

### 🏰 **Park Areas & Theming**
- **Disney-themed area overlays** for each land:
  - 💜 Fantasyland
  - 🩵 Tomorrowland
  - 🧡 Frontierland
  - 💚 Adventureland
  - ❤️ Liberty Square
  - 💙 Main Street U.S.A.
- **Semi-transparent circular areas** showing theme boundaries
- **Interactive area popups** with land information

### 📊 **Multiple Map Modes**

#### Standard Mode
- Clean map view with park areas and basic attraction markers
- Focus on navigation and general park layout

#### Wait Times Mode
- Wait times displayed directly on attraction markers
- Color-coded intensity based on current wait times
- **Smart filtering** by maximum acceptable wait time
- **Live legend** showing wait time color meanings

#### Heat Map Mode
- **Visual wait time intensity** using colored circles
- Larger, more intense circles for longer wait times
- **Dynamic opacity** based on wait time severity
- Park areas remain visible for context

### 🔧 **Advanced Controls**
- **Zoom in/out** buttons with smooth animation
- **Find my location** with GPS integration
- **Reset view** to original park center
- **Filter attractions** by type (all/rides/shows/dining)
- **Wait time slider** for filtering by maximum acceptable wait

### 🎨 **Enhanced UI/UX**
- **Comprehensive tooltips** on all interactive elements
- **Accessible design** with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Error messaging** for location and loading states
- **Responsive layout** that works on all screen sizes
- **Smooth animations** and transitions throughout

### 📱 **Smart Coordinate Assignment**
- **Intelligent area detection** based on attraction tags and names
- **Realistic coordinate distribution** within themed areas
- **Collision avoidance** for marker placement
- **Fallback coordinate generation** for attractions without GPS data

## Technical Implementation

### Libraries Used
- **Leaflet** (^1.9.4) - Core mapping library
- **React-Leaflet** (^5.0.0) - React integration layer
- **@types/leaflet** (^1.9.17) - TypeScript definitions

### Performance Optimizations
- **Memoized calculations** for filtered attractions and heat map data
- **Efficient re-rendering** with React.memo patterns
- **Lazy loading** of marker icons and overlays
- **Debounced user interactions** for smooth performance

### Accessibility Features
- **Screen reader support** with descriptive ARIA labels
- **Keyboard navigation** for all interactive elements
- **High contrast** marker design for visibility
- **Error state communication** for assistive technologies

### Mobile Optimizations
- **Touch-friendly** controls with appropriate sizing
- **Responsive breakpoints** for different screen sizes
- **Optimized performance** on mobile devices
- **Battery-conscious** location tracking

## API Integration

The component seamlessly integrates with existing APIs:
- **ThemeParks.wiki API** for park and attraction data
- **Wait time data** from live park feeds
- **Geolocation API** for user positioning
- **React Query** for efficient data caching and updates

## Customization Options

### Styling
- CSS modules for scoped styling
- Tailwind CSS integration for consistent design
- Dark mode support ready for implementation
- Customizable color schemes per park

### Data
- Supports any coordinate system (WGS84/GPS)
- Flexible attraction type system
- Extensible status and wait time formats
- Custom area definitions per park

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

### Advanced Features
- **Route planning** between attractions
- **Crowd density overlays** using historical data
- **Weather integration** with condition overlays
- **3D building models** for immersive navigation
- **Offline mode** with cached map tiles
- **Multi-language support** for international visitors

### Integrations
- **FastPass/Genie+ booking** directly from map
- **Dining reservations** at nearby restaurants
- **Photo locations** and character meet spots
- **Live event notifications** based on location
- **Social features** for group coordination

### Analytics
- **Heat maps** of guest movement patterns
- **Predictive wait times** using machine learning
- **Optimal route suggestions** based on current conditions
- **Park capacity indicators** and crowd predictions
